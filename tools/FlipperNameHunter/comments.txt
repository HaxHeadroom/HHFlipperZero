&gt; I was able to edit the file with the correct frequency and it seems to register in my garage opener gateway from Merlin (I can see the light cue when I try to register it), but when I try to emulate it to test, nothing happens, as if it does not recognize the key fob :(

Could be some variation that we don't support yet.
In that case, recording and replaying RAW is the last option. Also check our guides on reporting such protocols so we'll be able to add them in future https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/my-remote-isnt-supported-how-to-add-new-sub-ghz-protocol-in-flipper-zero/2033

Yes it was diluted, I used this YouTuber's technique [LauraSSBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGJBovw220). You can also check my 1st dye post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/v4azqu/dyed_flipper_zero_silicone_case_for_a_friend_who/) (I soaked the case for about 25 minutes in the dye at around 75C).

You can add fob then change frequency in the file.

Well...   


According to: [https://blog.flipperzero.one/certification-and-opening-sources/](https://blog.flipperzero.one/certification-and-opening-sources/) there have been 1 million names generated.  


&gt;*Each STM32WB55 microcontroller inside Flipper Zero has a unique serial number in hexadecimal format. But its boring, so we've decided to give each and every Flipper a unique, human-readable name. To do that, we took a neural network, trained it on Pokmon names, and as a result we generated a dictionary of over 1 million names. For even more uniqueness, the names are diluted with 1337-speak.*

  
Therefore your "8 billion" number is a bit off.   And with only like 25K flippers deployed, seems like there are many more name posts to look forward to.    


Reminds me, what is your flippers name?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Just a tip. Try looking at the brand, model and googling it to see what kind of hardware it has, compare it to the flipper and then if you cant figure it out, ask around.

If you beat the gate hard enough with the flipper it may open
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Frequencies limitations are based on your location/country. 

Try to read raw and set the frequency manually. If the 433 mhz frequency isnt there, it is restricted for you and your garage opener probably not legal.

It would be less because the pico uses less power (but is also less powerful), but neither the 0w and the pico can natively use 5ghz, you need to use a 5ghz usb adapter. At this point, you might as well just use something like a pwnagotchi and the flipper separately. Or, you could build you own WiFi module using a 5ghz WiFi module (I'm not even sure if any exist, maybe the ESP 32 c5?)

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Probably not, you can theoretically program the flipper to send signals over GPIO to get the rpi to do something like scan wifi networks or perform some other task, but you can't simply connect them together like a dual socket CPU motherboard or cluster computer. Its probably more effort (and bulk) than its worth. You need an external battery to power the rpi

I do some professional physical pentesting to financial companies and trainings for employees on security conscience, having the flipper both to point out their insecurities and catch the attention of employees during a training is perfect.

Sub-ghz: opening my garage doors, I also intend to study my car cryptography and maybe be able to open/close it in the future.

BadUSB: test and develop payloads for pentests, at some point Ill drop down some rubber duckys disguised as pendrives which will guide employees to the correct training vdeos in why you shouldnt do this 

GPIO: I want to usd it for daily injection in some hardware hacking, also maybe expand and test new components and hats

IR: turning off those annoying loud tvs at bars, who knows maybe shutting down when the opposing team is next to the goal line =)

NFC: I got an entire amiibo library now, and the possibility to use the same amiibo with smash brothers and something else at the same time. I also want to use the flipper as a virtual business card on conferences, just tap it and the person gets you contact details

Lfrfid: stop carrying so many of those stupid cards everywhere I go

Sadly it's not replaceable, as it's ultrasonically welded to the case and removing it would leave some pieces behind so a new one won't fit in that space

My biggest fear was the corrosion. It hadnt been submerged, but the backpack it was in got soaked. So the screen had condensation and the board was wet. There was some noticeable oxidation and corrosion. I used a toothbrush to clean as much as I could. Prior to understanding the comments (thank you all btw), I took it completely apart and put all the electronic pieces in a half full rice bag. Its been 3 days. It extracted enough moisture to clear the condensation from the screen and everything else seemed dry. So I put it back together. I connected the battery (after much praying) and all he wants now is a good charge . Ill test more functionality later, but he has life once more. Thank you all for the comments.

The approach would be to get hold of the remote and use the frequency analyzer to find the frequency the remote transmits on. Other option would be to do open source intelligence to find out the frequency. 

Once you have that you can record the signal, and try to replay it. If there is no rolling code security or other fancy stuff included in the RF it would most likely lead to success.

If it does rolling code you can try to register a few signals (out of range of the "secure" device) and it might think that the codes you transmit are still valid as they never have been used before.

Best of luck to you. It would suck if you were to reenable the frequency when you finally get it would be tragic.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
The biggest question here would be "Does the mechanism already accept remote commands?" if there is nothing like an RF frontend built in to receive the code to unlock the Sub-GHZ parts of the Flipper would not help much. If the security of the keypad is not strong enough you could use small solenoids triggered by code to bruteforce the access. DeBruyn (as used in OpenSesame) may come handy then based on how far shifting registers are used to process the user input. Or if you know the input... no bruteforcing needed... but you might still need to buld some RF Frontend then and getting this to be secure would rather be challenging.

In the picture the leather is still moist, once it dries it get lighter (like the background).

It has an RSSI label, so seems like a signal strength threshold. RSSI = Received Signal Strength Indication.

RSSI is also commonly used to triangulate location and distance to source. I have used Bluetooth RSSI to roughly locate people and objects relative to other sources.

I just picked up a portapack and have a flipper on-order and due this month. Would you mind sharing the code for both the portapack and the flipper? I tried the discord link but it is blank.

This is one of the main reasons I ordered one of these fun devices
-------------------------------

Because it doesn't use 4g? It used sub 1gz. 915mhz here in Australia.

I also received a refusal from the Ministry of Communications,  
violation-use of unlicensed frequencies.  
a bizarre marketing ploy from the Flipper team, they create something that can be sold but cannot be obtained.

This plus use isopropyl alcohol, ideally 90%+ and clean the PCB. Could be some stuff in the water you don't wanted lingering. Chlorine and salt are corrosive.

You can't do that. If you could that would be stealing and that is bad.

Helium is mostly LoRa.  The LTE/4g stuff is still *very* new and FreedomFi gateways are rare.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
But Helium uses 4G. How would the Flipper access that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
If you're just using it to send a, message to a sms gateway or something, yeah that's fine. 

In my case, I originally looks into running as IRC client on it and determined that it would get expensive quick as more people joined.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
This post made me laugh for a bit but then I started feeling sad for you. As the other posts say, please take your flipper apart and make sure every piece is dry beforehand assembling it back. Good luck for you and the flipper that doesn't swim.

I have both. The Portapack is pretty cool, but honestly I've gotten a lot more usage out of the Flipper Zero. It's easier to use, more portable (doesn't feel like it will break if I toss it in a backpack and it doesn't need a big antenna), as (as others have said) it has a lot more capabilities beyond RF.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Could it be 928MHz?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
I get a lot of 928MHz pings when I use the spectrum analyzer. Could that be it?

They must get an alert on their dashboard too. I found a guy chilling in his Tesla and I kept opening the charge flap but he was closing it again from inside the car, he looked very confused.

First time I did this was with my HackRF One Portapack. A woman was packing shopping in her Tesla and she kept pushing the flap closed, she looked really annoyed.

If you can - take the cover off and disconnect the battery connector!

Steps 1-4, 7-9.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Forget the rice. Open your Flipper, let it air dry for a long time. When you think it's dry enough, let it dry some more, then blow on it with canned air (like the ones we use to clean keyboards). Don't skimp on it, use the whole can if you feel like it.

If you feel comfortable doing it, take all the pieces apart and let them dry like that. It will not only be faster, but safer, too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
do not buy, the device does not pass the test from the Ministry of Communications. frequencies 915-927.95 MHz. 304.5-321.95 MHz

In just this case, some of the portapacks sold on Ali express, which already include a knockoff version of hackrf, might be the way to go. They are decently reviewed and similar in cost to the OG hackrf itself.

Oh okay its basically squelch? No worries thank you.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Trigger.... that makes more sense than 'tsensitivity'
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
"Trigger" - if you press right, you'll move that little arrow to the right and it won't beep and vibrate on weaker signals. It'll still show them on the display, though.

It's for filtering out noise and only bothering to alert you when a nearby device is transmitting. If you're far away from the target, leave it low; if you're sat next to it, crank it all the way up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-15
Great.
Thanks a lot.
I saw only a drawing of the case in flipper docs before.

I'm sure a serial based eeprom would be doable with the right code. An older eeprom might need additional hardware for the extra i/o lines.

 I actually have a radio here with a serial eeprom I've been meaning to pull a dump off because no programming software exists for it. 

You have me thinking now.

I'll gladly get one at some point. 

There's probably not much for options of adding threaded inserts for the screws huh? 

I know with "typical" fdm and thermoplastics it's easy to oversize your holes a bit and then press in a threaded inserts usually made of a brass with a solder iron or similar.

My ideal replacement case is going to also replace the screws because they are utter trash. Ideally I'll have little machine screws and proper threads. Not lead screws into tough plastic.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Ok I see. So the Hackrf can do everything the Flipper can when it comes to RF. Just much more powerful, thanks I appreciate it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
The Flipper Zero can interact with a lot more things you can see/touch vs. the HackRF One that can intercept and transmit a huge range of the RF spectrum.  Two completely different devices, with the only thing in common being sub-GHz reception and even that is quite limited on the F0.

Cost is considerably different too, the F0 is cheap by comparison to the plain vanilla HackRF One.  Once you add the porta-pack, you've blown well past $500.

In short:
Flipper Zero - work with NFC, RFID, select sub-GHz (key fobs, etc.), IR, GPIO, Bad USB (USB Rubberducky), U2F, some games and you can tweak FW/write software for functions &amp; screen.  Small, easy to carry and fairly ambiguous. 

HackRF One - RX/TX radio frequencies from 1 MHZ to 6 GHz, perform RF spectrum analysis with waterfall, intercept HAM Radio, Aviation transponders, NFC, RFID, satellite radio signals... pretty much anything that uses RF signals in the 1MHz-6GHz range.  Universal Radio Hacker, GNU Radio Companion and OpenDigitalRadio are some good starter  software packages.  A bit boxy, antennas make it considerably more conspicuous than F0.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
They are out of stock of the complete box, if you drop down the selection you will see there is an option for pi raspberry 2.

Think of a flipper as a swiss army knife. It can do a lot of different things, but mostly only at a basic level.


Now hackrf is focused on one area only, where it, compared to a flipper, shines. Let's compare it to a ... Idk big ol saw. It cuts trough wood pieces like a champ. No matter small ones or a whole tree. But it might not be the brightest idea to attempt to sew with it. Hackrf one then, focused on the RF stuff **can** do all of the things flipper can, **as long as we're talking purely about the RF bits of the flipper.**

You ain't emulating amiibos or a U2F HW with the hackrf.

It looks like for a first you did a great job!

If you're in the US and willing to ship a few of these name your cost and let me know!

I've only got an fdm printer, and I don't really use it at all unfortunately. Not for lack of want to, but mostly because I'm lazy and or have little time...

Maybe when I get my work office cleaned up a bit I'll move my printer there since I'm there almost as much as I'm at home....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
I had this guide on hand, but didn't really need it.  I used it when I used PETG to printed it "the old fashioned way" https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Flipper+Zero+Disassembly/151455

It was pretty intuitive. Release 4 screws on the bottom and 2 hold the "flipperguts" to the top case which completely free it. 

Since this was my first resin print, I had to learn a few things regarding how to finish and cure it.  

It's just about ready to drop into this new case.  Waited on a couple things. 

Will post pics as soon as it's in!

Cant say for right now but I went to Israel in 2015 and other than my passport being held by customs for about 30 minutes (I was 18, I assume they were checking if I had any citizenship that would require military service), once we got our bags we went to the nothing to declare doors and it literally led right to the exit.

I saw the SubGhz provisioning changes in both the firmware and the Android app, and I thought it was just to simplify Flipper stock (only have 1 hardware region - worldwide - and provision via Android or qFlipper afterwards).

I didn't realize the team was dealing with complying to new requirements, oof.  I appreciate the transparency here, and all the effort from the entire Flipper team.

Nice job.
Have you made a model from scratch?
I didn't find it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Yup. Ive had no issues raw dogging it in my pocket with keys and other hard items. Ive dropped it a few times and its still functioning perfectly.

Id say a case is pretty useful for drops.. otherwise, not really needed 

But again, everyone is different and will have different preferences

I love the Tesla trick found a Tesla in town the other day and tried it worked like a charm. The guy got out of his car I hit the command the door flipped open he looked very complex then confused he close the door I then immediately did it again he punched the car and started swearing at it was absolutely hilarious best entertainment ever

From the flipper discord:

  A mistake was made by our logistics partner, which has led to all EU and UK tracking links showing that these orders were cancelled. Please note that your order has not actually been cancelled, and will be shipped out normally as scheduled. New tracking numbers will be sent out soon.

Mine charges super slowly too, around 33-40 mA plugged into my computer. Is it supposed to be faster if you plug into a wall charger? I've also had times where it says it's charged, but it's actually not because as soon as I disconnect it from the USB, it powers off.  Then I'll replug it into a different USB port and it'll report that it's like 44% full which is odd because there's no way it discharged all that juice within the span of a couple seconds.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Wait, so I am not the only Israeli having this problem? And you know 4 sure current flipper is not compliant with Israeli laws?
Cuz I'm still not sure. gonna file another request to Ministery of communication. Might save us from shipping this thing to and from china. Again.
Will update soon 
-------------------------------

We don't impose any frequency restrictions through hardware.

Frequency restrictions are applied by the firmware, based on a region flag written into one-time programmable memory.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Thanks for clearing that up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Currently, region restrictions are based on a single bit in the one time programmable memory, and we have 3 different versions of this for different regions (R01, R02, R03). The new version will have the exact same difference as the other models, which is just a single bit in the OTP.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, exactly the same product.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
If it's just a firmware change, that'd be great. To me it sounded like new hardware that would enforce certain restrictions 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Sounds like a more strict firmware restriction similar to the ones for US/UK but you could unlock this restriction yourself? Correct me if I'm wrong of course.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Where do you share it? :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
&gt; with dynamic frequency restrictions

so not the same then
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Sub-GHz transmitting frequencies :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
use a shipping service, its how china buys off of e-bay. I dont have a service for your country myself sorry.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
No, it's the exact same product, just with dynamic frequency restrictions based on geolocation.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
This thing is getting out of hand and we should stop.....but it's too much fun, isn't it? 

Carry on!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
So people would be getting a different product than what they ordered/backed?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
what part of the device did they take issue with?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
FWIW, I don't think you're lying at all, but like almost every other company, we require proof that a product is defective in order to replace it, otherwise everyone can just go around claiming it's broken for a free replacement :)

On top of this, if it is a fixable issue then having a video of the issue can help us analyze and determine a possible solution so that you can get your device working again without having to wait for a replacement.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Youre good man.

I saw it on the discover page on kickstarter and remember thinking to myself: man I would love to learn and use this thing.
But life happens 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
We are currently working on a new version of Flipper Zero that would be 100% compliant with Israeli laws, and we will be shipping those to Israeli customers instead once the rejected ones return.

That does I am sorry

They really are funny to look at. The shells are made of a semi-translucent material that lets the ir signal pas through it and to the receiving led on the top of the unit. They only have a range of about 3-4 metres, but considering they're the size of an eraser, you probably don't want to lose line of sight anyway. No antennas whatsoever.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
An IR controlled RC car, that's hilarious. Do you have to run constantly behind it or are there multiple IR sensors on it? Maybe it's on top of a fake antenna for visibility.

Customs and border enforcement is interesting places. Every country I have been has been a mixed bag depending on who is working and what you look like.

Pretty much anything electronic device, cash, jewelry, or any other valuables are at risk when crossing borders.

But ya even with an x-ray machine I doubt they would take it unless they are in a mood. 

I probably wouldn't keep it when you are going through the airports, I'd stash it with the rest of your chargers and cables for your phone and tablet and flash drives so it looks like it is part of an average travellers kit and not something special.

1 : 2022-08-14
oh I haven't even set the flag tho
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
yup, I've been using the update folder. 

The flag i'm talking about is the one that allows transmitting to restricted frequency, the .txt file with that flag gets overwritten every time I update, the 'true' gets reverted back to 'false'.

it's annoying as hell as there is no way to go in there and change that flag without removing the microSD
this defeats the purpose of flashing from the update folder... may as well just update with Qflip and remove the microSD for the data, least I can make the change right away.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
where do you update? Which flag do you have to set?
I don't update since the last time I updated after installing the RM firmware, I got the official and had to reinstall RM from the update folder on my SD Card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
This I can agree with

They happen in the official discord server. Most of the time, they are recorded and transcribed to [this repo](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-questions-and-answers). Although the recent session was not "official", and they did not record it because they were expecting only a few people. This recent session was where it was answered, iirc by UberGuidoZ
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Probably not
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
any tips for not having to set that flag to true after every update?

Dude, how the hell would I know?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
I'm in the same boat. I imagine those who ordered it earlier got it faster and those of us who were further down the list have to wait a bit longer. Hopefully we won't need to wait too much longer because it would be great to get mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
I had an iPhone for a little while and it got beat up pretty quickly. Mileage varies depending on user. I'm sure the Zero could survive a drop test well past where the 6S would break.

AFAIK, the "detect reader" function is for a different type of attack on Mifare Classic cards where you gather data from both the card and the reader to solve the cards access key instead of bruteforcing it. It's still a WIP to my knowledge.

Please stop asking about illegal things for the flipper, it makes the rest of us look bad

I'm pretty sure you can't emulate bank cards with the flipper. You can but it won't work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
I love the creativity of this "no" 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
No and this is a crime
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-14
Yes, but the flipper has no OS detection, so you need a different payload per operating system (at least until we get DSv3 support lol)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
 No and if it was the risk:reward ratio would be terrible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
no
-------------------------------

Anything you can plug a keyboard into, so yes.
-------------------------------

I see you say you ordered Mid July? Are you in North America? I ordered mine July 7th, and have yet to see the tracking information.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Without being rude, if you need to ask, it's probably not for you
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Wow thank you for this amazing tip 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Yes. First this hack only works if you have a case for the flipper that is made of metal. The metal case will block outside RF interference. Next have an emulated credit card NFC chip from your credit card loaded to it. It won't charge you, I promise. Next hold the flipper about 2 feet away from the vending machine while it's emulating your credit card. Now quickly move the flipper toward the vending machine as fast as you can, and smash the metal case against the glass. Repeat this until the glass shatters. You now have free snacks, and like I told you, it did not charge your credit card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Last time I checked my iPhone is stainless steel and glass and my flipper is made of plastic. My flipper has screen scratches from only about a week of being carried in my pocket.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
No.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
As much as its killing me, itll be well worth the wait. Ive been wanting one for soooo damn long lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
That was what I was thinking. But I will admit, there are hundreds of designs of vending machines. Who knows, there maybe some weird bluetooth, rfid, nfc refill process/distribution process on some vending machine made by a Thai company for a Polish business that runs out of Argentina? Though at the end of the day, the easiest way would be to put a hole through the glass.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Just ordered mine today. What are the shipping times looking like for everyone? im in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
It should
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Yea it's gonna be like 2 months after we get a tracking number
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
exactly what are you going to do with that? definitely looks anything but legal lmfao
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
That's an entirely different radio system though. This is kinda like asking to clone a remote starter for a car that doesn't have one.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
no, legally what you *can* do is support the owner of the machine by emulating your card on the reader though :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Waiting for the August wave drop in USA to ship too. I ordered screen protectors, they shipped last week and wont be here until mid September.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
I don't know? Can it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Some vending machines take credit cards. I think they look like they have a cell data connection to process the cards. Not sure that it would give you much eats though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Not really, I just got mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Why would this be a radio frequency? The vending machine is all wires connected together.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
This! Holy shit it's tiresome.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Yeah, the best frequency is around 1/2 Hz as you physically rock the machine back and forth!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Should be a rule on here banning stupid illegal shit like this. Anyway, vending machines don't have IR or RF. Some do have card readers though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
I ordered July 7th still waiting I'm in NA
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
The flipper can emulate a card. You cant add chips or anything like that though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Could have been the wrong sub.. anyways no updates yet 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Mines been like that for like 4-5 days and I havent gotten any shipping confirmation.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
No
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Minutes. I even emailed asking if I could add on the Wi-Fi board to the order I just placed, and they said it was not possible, I would have to order separately with separate shipping. So I just bought a esp32 marauder instead
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Very nice, I see you already have the RM firmware :) have fun with it!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Exactly what I said I sent it to them took 2 days to get there. They fixed it in a few hours and sent it back the same day they got it. It then took 2 days to get back to me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Uhh.. what?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Bummer. Ive been wondering the same thing for a while now. Makes sense though. I want to try it on vending machines when i get mine and see if i can replay the frequency to get extra snacks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
So 2 days there it was there for a few hours they put in a trigger bar and a trigger and then sent it back the same day so less than a week.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
If you take a look at the RougeMaster repo (simply because thats what Im used to) you can see an /assets folder and go further into /assets/resources and should see infrared. In this folder there are a few files given for your use but opening them up you will see these are actually.ir files with this same syntax.

TL;DR The flipper might be able to use the file you already have. Try some stuff out to make it fit the other files and see what happens, always the best way to learn.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
You could, in theory, emulate the card itself  add money to it at D&amp;B, and use it to play their games. But you'd be paying real money to add the credits, just like if you were using their card. This is just emulating a card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
What about the machines will that work? Sorry I found out about this today
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
No. The chips are not stored on the card. My understanding is that the card is just an ID#. The chips are stored in a central database.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
You can do basic operations with IR like on/off but I haven't messed around with trying to do navigation.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
The ones waiting is because their country is holding it at entry, that's not the fault of the company
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
They are asking about public open store orders not yalls kickstarter orders.....of course it took two years for yours, you literally pre-ordered during their development and payed to help finish it into production 

Now stop being annoying on every post cause yall don't know how development kickstarters work and wanted them to give it to you right then and there

for what its worth, "rolling code" is heavily present in offline systems that facilitate triggering automations on the system, hotels, office keys, temporary access. 

it may be a matter of geography but writeback rolling code is very present on this side of the pond

It really depends from what I have seen I missed the campaign and had my email listed to be notified when they were in stock again one day I looked on the website and it said they were in stock I ordered and received it in a couple of weeks. Yet I am seeing campaign backers that seem still to be waiting for theirs
-------------------------------

That's okay man! It's really not that hard to begin coding nowadays. I'd recommend to start coding in python. It's easy to learn the basics. And with that knowledge you can pretty easily learn other languages. 

There are a lot of free courses online that you can try. But I'd recommend to just make little projects. Get inspiration from other people's work and learn from them. 

And to make bad USB code is not hard at all. Just search up ducky script and try to do something with that, for example open up a browser and go to a website. Ducky script can easily be translated to something that the flipper app understands with tools that you can find online.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Thanks man I really didnt know what I can do ! But I got it so I can chang people wifi to rickroll , but I really want to learn how to code / make my own bad usb , but I never got into coding or anything so I wouldnt know where to start and I feel its to hard to start now

The marauder on the flipper dev board isn't documented that great though. You have to figure out the commands a bit. Hopefully it'll be updated soon!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
No worries man! There's also a lot of other firmwares you can flash to it. It's basically an esp32-s2 so you can flash anything made for that. [here's](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Wifi_DevBoard/ReadMe.md) some projects you can do with it :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Thank you man !! I was worried I needed to buy a marauder but no I can flash my dev board with it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
No it doesn't. 

Where is this info on the GitHub page?
What GitHub page? 

Do you mean the plugin creator [Ownasaurus](https://github.com/Ownasaurus/flipperzero-firmware/tree/hid-analyzer) or do you mean [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)? I see no info on either repo which details specialized hardware to use the HID analyser nor answers OPs question.

Getting real tired of the people 'helping' by saying the info is available without actually helping the user find the info, which often doesn't exist in the first place due to how fast things change in flipper development.

Here is words from the plugin creator:
&gt;"Here is a binary with an additional module: HID Analyzer. If you touch it to a HID card, it should tell you its bit-ness. This way if someone wants to know why their card isn't supported, you could have them test with this, and they could see if its something like HID34 or HID37"

There were some issues mentioned with the HID analyser on discord but apparently it's been fixed in latest build.

As u/Big-Bork said, best thing is to update to latest version, if that doesn't work ask in the discord.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
the HID analyser plugin does not require extra hardware where did you get that idea
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
If they're protected with a password and you don't know it - no, you can't copy it without the password
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
it requires specialized hardware. this info is available on the GitHub page
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Did you update to the newest version? One got released just 20 m ago. Otherwise maybe try reinstalling and re extracting the resources zip file for the newest plugin version.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Okay, I understand now, was just confused when using those auth options yielded 16/16 keys. 

If cracking is impossible due to the limited number of tries, is there then just no way to copy ultralight keys? Would love to do when we're in a hotel somewhere.

Mine is Bluetooth and I think we could integrate but I'm trying to do so, maybe there is some one else who has faced the same problem and solve it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Okay, but what is with Bluetooth ? It is integrated in the Flipper, but currently there is just one App (Remote) included. There are so many things we can do with Bluethooth like a BTLE Scanner/Sniffer. Is there a DEV outthere that will develop some cool Bluetooth Stuff ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
What gen apple tv is it? If the remote works with IR you can just read it with the flipper and make your own remote.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
You should try the spectrum analyzer to see what specific frequency it is. And try to read it on that frequency. I don't have one that sends those kinds of pings or anything so I can't try it sadly :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Basically anything made for the esp32-s2 could be put on the board. So tinker away :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Yes I am sure, there are Tesla signals recorded in EU and US. If you try to play US signal in EU on original FW you wont be able to due to tx lock. You need to have signal recorded for EU frequency
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
From my experience working with RFID and NFC at work, outside of Flipper stuff: almost all RFID communications are unencrypted or use a symmetric key. NFC is more varied, it depends on the application since more advanced encryption means a more expensive chip baked into the fob/card which can add up in total cost very quickly.

It is not uncommon to see AES or 3DES encryption in NFC. Most of the time a tag or card will have a publicly readable serial number and _that_ is what's used as a personal identifier. It's tremendously lazy and insecure and is probably the Achilles heel of most security systems.

There are NFC cards that support much more advanced security like RSA or ECC encryption, random number generation and signing to prevent the kind of replay attacks we would use with a Flipper. From my experience working with those at my job, they're very expensive, very hard to order, and hard to configure. I'd love to work on a patch to support the NXP SmartMX series, but how the private keys are stored in those cards actually makes it super difficult to copy them non-destructively.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
There's pretty much no such thing as a "rolling NFC". That's simply not how that works.

All of RFID is a matter of 2 way communication.

Sometimes the communication is as simple as: give power, I spit back my id / serial number endlessly, 


And as complicated as: you give power, select me as a cart so I know you want to communicate, then issue a command, authenticate for it using private/symmetric key, I'll process it and you get some kind of result out of it using encrypted communication.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
There is many versions of the captured files for each region.
Just get the one that was recorded for your region.

To what country?  It varies a lot.  I ordered a second flipper (wanted one stock and one for alternative firmware) and it arrived in 3 weeks.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Are you sure? 

As I understand, there are limitations on frequency depending on which region you are in. 
When i tried to send it before switching from the original firmware, it didn't work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Tesla Signal can be used in every region lol. Even with original firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Roguemaster's hahahaha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
You can start by putting the esp32 marauder on it found [here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder)
It's an easy start and roguemaster's firmware already has a plugin for it. :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
Thanks! Can you explain the difference?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-13
I currently use Rougemasyer but I generally will update to either  that or unleashed depending on which is more stable at the time

https://flipperzero.one/ on the page it says:

"Flipper has an integrated 433MHz antenna, and a CC1101 chip, which makes it a powerful transceiver capable of up to 50 meters range."

I have not started working again on the rickbomb as I accidentally run pool forkbombed my main vm instead of a clone lol. So I might as well setup an 11 iso as well. I will look into window relocation through PS and see if I can throw some brick of code I find somewhere in the loop. First I gotta get the looping rickbomb to work before I can get a last resort like effect on it, but great idea!

Definitely not a toy, looks like a toy, but is WAY more powerful. You can use it for a ton of legit purposes. I use mine both for messing around and also for work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
To get the most out of it, you should know a little bit of C, how technology like RFID, NFC, and some wireless frequencies work, but bare minimum is how to use a computer and how to follow directions. The rest (the ones I mentioned to get the most out of it) can be learned along the way, they're not a prerequisite to use it
-------------------------------

If you want to learn wifi pentesting, the flipper is probably not a great way to start. Start by messing around on the computer first, then you can take your skills over to the flipper. Start by trying to capture a wifi handshake with aircrack-ng or capture some packets with wireshark

Ahh, right on.  You didn't mention which system in your other post, and OP was talking specifically about IR, so naturally assumed that's what you were referring to.

Re: recording traffic, yeah that would be a metric crapton of storage space to save city-wide footage.  Wonder if they would have a "If emergency vehicle forces light change: Then save snapshot" kind of system...

All the ones I've seen in the US have that little white light on the poles that's either blinking or solid depending on which way it's coming from.  I'd imaging if that started going off with no sign of an emergency vehicle, people would start reporting it left and right.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
Great man! 

Have a look at roguemaster's firmware [here](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)

And for the wifi dev board the esp32 marauder [here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder)

[here](https://github.com/RogueMaster/awesome-flipperzero-withModules) are some great goodies to use with the flipper like IR databases and subgHz files 

Have fun! :)

I was referring to the RF one, not the strobe one. To beat the cameras, maybe you could hit it with a laser from some distance off, out of the camera's field of view. 

Other places are going to be different, but the cameras in my area do not record, they are just for seeing live traffic conditions. This was confirmed by 2 different police officers, as well as a highway department worker who was working on traffic lights. The cost to store even a few days footage over the whole city is way outside of the budget.

I wouldn't know how the extra animations got there. But as far as I know you should put the new animations in the external folder. And don't forget to create a meta.txt file and update the manifest.txt file one folder up. I don't know that much about the animations. For more i fo you can check out the graphics channel in the flipper discord [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://discord.com/invite/flipper&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjks6K0zMH5AhUOGuwKHYwKBPkQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vioIEda7rBSQmdlfFaJzZ)

The cover works great and is barely noticeable under the silicone cover and keeps the pogo pins or ibutton features from getting stuck on pockets.

So, also a n00b here with a flipper on the way. Can I use the wifi dev board to run something like pwnagotchi to get information on available wifi? Or are we talking about being connected to wifi and attempting to capture packets between other devices and the router, etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
Oh I dont doubt that they wouldnt make an example out of me or whoever. Not saying Id use this if possible to change every stop light every day. It would be more of a see if I can and learn from it. If I were able to do it Id zoom around 3 am with no traffic on my Onewheel and see if I can get it to work reliably.

You have to change the animations before the firmware is built. If you check out assets/dolphin/external on the flipper GitHub [here](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware), you can see there's just plain png's :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
Nice! Thanks, man
-------------------------------

No worries dude. Plugins are just apps that you can put on the flipper. There are already some integrated in roguemaster's firmware like a Bluetooth remote, a barcode generator, a spectrum analyzer. They're programs mostly written in C I think. 

And hardware modules are extensions to the flippers hardware. The flipper itself doesn't have wifi, but with the wifi dev board (you can buy that from the flipper website) you can dut stuff with wifi like capture packets and stuff. You can plug modules into the gpio ports on top of the flipper. 

But all this isn't necessary to have fun with the flipper. Check out [this](https://github.com/RogueMaster/awesome-flipperzero-withModules) repo, theres a lot of stuff there you can do with the flipper. And also check you roguemaster's firmware [here](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins).

Its honestly better to think of flipper as a toy for learning pen testing. I havent used mine yet but that is the vibe that Ive been getting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
I definitely need to brush up on a few things. Im not sure what plug-ins or hardware modules are.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
Youre asking the kinds of questions, just have the wrong targets :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
The main thing is that you have to be willing to learn. Everything is pretty doable and there's a lot of community support on Reddit/discord/forums. 

If you have a bit of basic computer skills you'll come a long way. 

The flipper is like a swiss army knife, it can do a lot of things, but nothing too complicated. And the more you learn, the more you can do with it. Once you've figured out the stock firmware, you can install a custom one like roguemaster's, you can build plugins, build hardware modules. 

If you're actually interested and have the will, you can learn a lot from using this thing. I love tinkering around with mine :)
-------------------------------

Being comfortable on a computer helps, most issues I see are from not following directions and not being very computer literate. 

If you can follow directions like a recipe, most problems can be avoided, despite any computer knowledge.

Otherwise it's actual operation is easy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
So you got a lot of good options here. Heres the thing, mine did the same. Just leave it on and set the flipper on its head over night and that will flatten back out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
That is definitely true!

Are you referring to the official release update using qflipper? I'm currently on 0.63.0 and there is no apps dir on my sdcard. Does this mean I should format my card and redo the initial update?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
I just went through the process of flashing alternative FW to be able to override the Flipper level and also change animations. You can also disable whatever animations you don't like.

In the /dolphin folder, there is a manifest.txt file, listing all the animations it can cycle through. Simply delete the block related to the animation you don't like - the one in your image is Rukamon, there are two of them. Delete the block, copy the file over the original manifest.txt, and you will never see the animation again. Keep the original manifest by changing the file name to something like manifest\_old.txt if you want to go back.

Thank you. It never hurts to do the research into what is possible and push the limits

Years ago I read an article about someone who made a device to change the IR activated traffic light sensors.  He got an array of IR LEDS and played around with it.  I think he ended up pulsing it at 50% duty, 10hz, and was able to change lights pretty reliably.    
On the other hand, I'm pretty sure the flipper doesn't have sufficient output power to activate a traffic signal, from what I've seen you need a pretty powerful array.

Basically, Mifare Ultralight tags have an option to protect them with a password. This feature tries to read tags with a known password generation algorithm. However, many password-protected tags have an internal counter of unsuccessful password attempts, and block the password feature outright once it reaches zero (that's what the warning is for). 

If you try reading your tag with any of those features while your tag is not actually an Amiibo/Xiaomi purifier tag - you'll get unpredictable behavior, so I really don't recommend using these features not for their untested purpose.

No genius, but you need interest in the product/tech else it will be laying around, I never learned to code and flipper made me start learning to code. So for me its an awesome device, to others who dont take /have the time to learn or have interest, its pretty much useless.

They're basically the same, the only difference to my knowledge is the size and the number of available gpio pins. The NodeMCU is a bit bigger and has more pinouts. The Wemos is slightly smaller and less pins, but I think it has stackable add on boards. Oh yeah and on the NodeMCU you can also use Lua scripts.

They can do the same things but it really depends on what you're gonna use it with.
-------------------------------

I remember back a long time ago that with a specific Sony or Panasonic "handycam" that would "See through clothes" when you used the night vision feature during day light with certain white fabrics. The media and public lost their shit. You know, because IR passes through certain fabrics...

The traditional device was called a "MIRT." Google should reveal the signal specs.

It's trivial to add a camera to the lights to record the vehicles using such devices or to log them. If the local system has the bus signal as well as the emergency services one, it's better to use that as, while you don't get the same priority, the use of the bus signal is far less likely to be audited. If you intend to use this in anger rather than just as an experiment and they have logs, getting caught is a distinct possibility and the unauthorised use of such a device is a crime in many places that have it

Yeah youre right, I just saw a video on the flipper and got a little overexcited 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
That's....not what it's supposed to do.

And trust me, as someone who went through school and tried to avoid it as much as possible, this small little party trick (even if it works) won't stop classes and assignments. You will just revert back to dumb black/white boards, because the school and the teachers will be tired of relying on them. Teachers are there to teach you, if they can't rely on active boards, they won't. But they will do their jobs, i can assure you. And if they find out you are doing it, you will get into trouble as well.

It's a cool party trick maybe once to impress your classmates, but other than that, you won't do anything good for yourself.

But to answer your question it depends how the smart board works. I've used ones that were just glorified projectors with and infrared remote, those the flipper can turn on and off. I've also used automatic ones that use HDMI detection, to my knowledge those can't be turned off in the traditional way (only the lack of HDMI), so flipper can't do anything. So it depends how modern your smart board is.

If you get a flipper, use it to learn how active boards work. Or anything else. But don't disrupt the class, cause you'll just screw yourself (and the class) over.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-12
IMO its a tool thats more about learning than utility. Learning about protocols and how tech out in the world works. If you dont have time for that and youre only interested in doing illegal stuff with it, its probably best to sell it (and stay out of jail).

for people worrying about this potentially causing accidents, these systems don't allow emergency vehicles to suddenly change red lights to green, they just extend the duration of green light until the ev passes through.

&amp;#x200B;

from *pedestrian signals control feature:*

&gt;*"An amber change interval and any required red clearance interval for any signal phase that*  
*is green or amber when preemption is initiated and which will be red during the preemption*  
*interval. The length of the amber change and red clearance intervals shall not be altered by*  
*preemption. Phases, which are in the green interval when preemption is initiated, and which*  
*will be green during the preemption period shall remain green. Any pedestrian WALK interval*  
*in effect when preemption is initiated shall be immediately terminated. The normal pedestrian clearance interval may be abbreviated."*

No you don't, but you have to want learn. All the information to use a flipper is out there. BUT you have to want to use it and have to want to learn, otherwise yes it is useless. 

I personally have bought one to learn. I am by no means a tech genius but I want to learn and the flipper has helpen massievely with that.

Well bummer dumb shit heads are everywhere. Nurses are hauling ass through intersections killing kids regardless. Shit parents are killing their own kids by accident all the time.

Better question. Why do you think you need one?

Flipper can do cloning and read NFC cards, and it can emulate it, but thats about it. It can't do advanced things. 

A proxmark can do all of the above, and it can clone most cards, excluding the ones that are encrypted or not broken. It also can attack card readers, something that the flipper cannot do, but the proxmark can't do GPIO, BadUSB attacks, U2F, Subghz, etc. 

Think of the flipper as a swiss army knife. It's a jack of all trades tool, but it's a master of none. The proxmark is like a screwdriver. It performs very well at one thing, but it can't do anything else.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
the proxmark can do all of what the flipper is capable of and more. it has the hardware designed for the task. allowing it to execute higher demand attacks and facilitate more chipsets (read iso14443-B etc)

the flipper can do the basics (arguably what most people want out of rfid) but a proxmark can do the full suite. 

think of it like a bicycle vs a motorbike.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
So you're saying if I wanted to i could hit every stop light?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Flipper can do some asic cloning of a few cards, it can also read several NFC card types, and there's work on emulation too. It can't "sniff" comms between reader and card, or crack passwords.

The PM 3 can do all of the things FZ can, but it can also clone 80% of cards out there, with the exception of ones with strong encryption like DESFire, or protocols that have not been broken. It can identify tags, decrypt some data, perform various attacks on readers and cards, as well as emulate various cards. It's more "hands on" as you need knowledge of how it works, and what the commands are. Having a basic knowledge of how prox and access systems work is also helpful

They'd have a hard time telling what vehicle changed it, as it changes all the traffic lights in that direction. Light turns green, and all the cars going that way start moving like normal.

I didn't take it as an accusation either, I just wanted to make it clear that I had earned the Lvl.

I appreciate your comment and think like you; it's not cool.

I'm very happy with Batby and my progress. Wanted to share, it's all :)

My flipper allows me to comunicate with osama bin laden (using 420hz) and the pope (666hz).

Also (and since I've intalled a cfw) I've been able to change the setting of ALL kinds of pacemakers.. grampa running at 140bpm?? Yes please!!!11!1!!


...I don't see anything wrong with it...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Oh right, I didn't see his comment.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Thank you very much! Works fine now!
-------------------------------

I recorded the raw signal away from the gate and played the recording later with the flipper, it opened the gate ones but didn't work again, after that the remote did not worked any more... Luckily i have a spare one
-------------------------------

Interesting indeed,
And a bit scary too lol

I got that on my first tries as well.  You have to get the github app on your PC, and it basically downloads the directory  to your PC, like a mirror, then when your looking for files to upload, they are held locally.  So not as easy as saving a jpg, but must be a reason why it's like that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
yes there is a option to turn all lights purple which causes full mayhem
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Yup! Sorry.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Lol

Stop taking it off
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Sorry that you took it that way, daguilerastc, I wasn't implying you cheated and didn't mean for it to come across like that.  I just wanted to be clear that I too hit level 2 by running the F0 through its paces.

I know there are quite a few people running RM doing the level hack that think it's cool jumping to 3 without earning it, simply because they can.  Sure, it's fun tweaking the FW and all, but why bother leaving it there, they aren't fooling anyone but themselves.  Let your dolphin level.  
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I see, thanks

If you guys wanna play with traffic patterns look at the cannonballers an their cars as a base, their vehicles are setup to manipulate traffic.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Wait. Whats the radio freq to change street lights??
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
If your interested in more advanced apps or plugins, Id update to an unleashed firmware. Not very difficult at all to install and expands what you can do with your flipper. If you happen to have a 3D printer this is a fantastic storage and portable case for the flipper: https://www.printables.com/model/204882-flipper-zero-case and heres a great GitHub for all the apps plugins cases you could possibly need: https://www.printables.com/model/204882-flipper-zero-case Hope this helps. Have fun!

I educated em in their comments
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
PRO TIP for everybody thinking about this modern traffic systems log everything and have cameras, unless it's the Italian job and your gta g ride is plateless you're one radio call away from being picked up. I love this idea, but i'm more interested in finding out if the led light bars on the vehicles themselves how those are controlled. I wanna play with their lights and not traffic patterns as that has great potential for casualty, where as the other just has one confused person lol.

No host or client capabilities, spi is so slow in testing it took 3 mins just to load grub.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Probably can run analyzer to make sure its in the 900mhz range and then try capture when the transponder is active. Unless they use the shorter range radio which flipper can't capture.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I basically live in Egypt but in the USA so take some guesses.
-------------------------------

Thats what I was thinking. All for one and one for all.
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, stupid people can create a lot of problems for popular products. Look at the OnePlus 8 Pro phone with it's IR camera, now permanently disabled because idiots were saying it was an x-ray camera.

Sounds like an opportunity to capture a raw sub and share with the community for testing and demonstration purposes.

Modern headlights have no issues triggering optical ones if you know the timing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Waaaaa? I didn't even know that was a technology. where in the world are you?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
This guy has no idea what he's talking about.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
The old optical systems used a xenon strobe. Headlights did not change fast enough to send data signals. At least, not incandescent ones.

On the other hand, the fine [was only $50 in in 2006](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna12365330).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
These are very good news.

I am thrilled which features comes to flipper in the next month.

Thank you.

u/awesomefacepalm Reading into thread pooling on MS docs it does indeed create a system process. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/the-managed-thread-pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/the-managed-thread-pool)

Reading into this I also came across a section called "Skipping security checks" an a function called "ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem", there happens to be a warning in that links doc saying "Caution  
Using UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem could inadvertently open up a security hole. Code access security bases its permission checks on the permissions of all the callers on the stack. When work is queued on a thread pool thread using UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem, the stack of the thread pool thread will not have the context of the actual callers. Malicious code might be able exploit this to avoid permission checks."...interesting.
-------------------------------

yikes lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
In my city the busses have some sort of transmitter to force traffic lights to change on the bus only turn offs, might be worth camping out for an hour to analyse and capture some signals
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
And Ive got a little defect on the screen from an errant solder blob when I was adding the SD card slot to the Wi-Fi dev board.  Life scars.  
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Right the only advantage I have is work on all the city state sheriff ambulances and so on vehicles so I get to play around with a lot of them.
-------------------------------

"EDC bag
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Police, fire and EMS all have a transponder, if one could raw capture the 915mhz it might work....the most security on them is the "code" your city uses, which could easily be brute forced.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
See Im uncertain of the whole thing works but Ive watched a few videos of what they are based around and I have a few cop buddies that said theyd let me experiment. If I get my hands on anything Ill let you guys know.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Yeah I figure its illegal but its not like Ive never dabbled in illegal things.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Delicious!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
It's subghz because the only range the Flipper can do is 915mhz. They have optical and radio, optical triggers off the flashing of the headlights, most cities operates on 915mhz because it's cheap and reliable. However there's no security, other than if caught tampering with a traffic control device is a crime.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Yes, works now, so for instance when I tried to download the tesla files initially they were 151kb, but using the github thing that mirrors the contents on my computer, it's about 10kb.  The sub ghz and ir stuff all work now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Oooo... that's a very good idea. I spent some time combing the patent docs for the systems from Opticom. I sincerely doubt that the emitter in the Flipper could trigger one of these systems, but on the other hand, they're probably intense enough that you could pretty easily record one from a passing emergency vehicle.

Keep in mind that, in the older systems at least, the emitter appears to be a xenon strobe, not an LED.  That would seem to suggest a lower limit to how fast they can signal.  It might be quite a bit slower than LED IR systems.

I was wondering if just a slow-motion video of a passing emergency vehicle would be sufficient to pick out a pattern.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
No but i am interested. Also is it legal?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Did it desynch so quickly? I figured it would have a margin of error like cars have.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I have not cheated. I have scanned many keys, RFID, nfc cards, amiibos, etc... I have unsynchronized my car key twice... The firmware is still totally original. I have only added plugins that compiled fine on the development firmware without errors, no system apps or modifications.

Good job!  Mine hit level 2 as well, without the "cheat.". No point in taking the fun out of it.  
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I bet you could check this by changing the time on you PC e.g. to 2030. Then the flipper thinks he slept a couple of years once he retrieves the time.

Good idea. I'll look into it

I take it from Roguemaster firmware...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
IIRC, the tamagotchi side of things is implemented to gamify it, not to punish users who don't partake or only use it for specific things. It wouldn't make any sense to brick a device for lack of feeding a specific feature.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Hope so..

You'll likely get it by Tuesday.

I ended up buying from there, 19 shipment with tracking they say 4-8 days, lets see
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Same boat
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Oh they're legit all right! Bought from them a few times already. Shipping could be a tad less overall but still the cheapest option for us ... more less...

Lab401 its safe ? Find a site a bit sketchy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Of course, u pay almost more fees and shipment then the actual product, that sucks for the flipper zero as well they could be making more money and enterprises like tnt and fedex fucking it up
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I saw lab401.com, some user put it here, and its more cheaper there, but dont know seems a bit sketchy

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
I'm very glad that when I ordered the flipper via Kickstarter two years ago, the whole thing cost me 179 even with shipping to Slovakia... Now it's almost double????
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Found this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/whu6c1/flipper\_as\_usb\_system\_host/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/whu6c1/flipper_as_usb_system_host/)

I also checked the documentation, but that didn't clear anything up for me.

Sorry to hear about your neck, but I 100% recommend getting one, having a neck is pretty awesome
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-11
Yeah, I did check both task manager and process hacker.

I could see the threads on PS, but they seemed unchanged.

But I believe that the extraction process spawns as a "System" process, which makes it harder to track.

It could be possible to do a trace and check it with with a windows ADK tool, but that's beyond me.
After all I'm more of a Linux and hardware guy.

1 : 2022-08-11
I found a small older padded case for a digital camera (or something similiar)  in a drawer at home where I can fit the Flipper, the cable and some other tiny gadgets. I keep it in my bag.

It's not very easily accessed, granted, but it keeps my lil' darling safe.

Note that this is not available in the stock firmware (if that wasn't already obvious)

1 : 2022-08-11
I'm more of a linux person myself, in 10 you can double click the cores in the stock task manager to show threads or maybe its a right click function. I know there is a way in the stock task manager and process hacker was a popular one. It's really far few and between that I ever actually have to do something with a win system. So i'm probably not the best resource myself. But win did introduce winget as repo like functionality and their new terminal isn't half bad, and you can always use chocolatey as repo like functionality for system monitoring software as well. It's almost like they are slowly cloning all the real functionality from unix and making win not such trash, aside from pre installed adware/telemetry bs anyway.

Do you know the name of the file that needs to be edited? Do I need to re-recompile/re-build the firmware or would this something that sits in the SD?

If you want to buy to Slovakia, I recommend that you write to this store: https://sapsan-sklep.pl/

My second one was ordered in May and was delivered as promised around end of June. 

What I was trying to say is don't hold your breath in the flipper one when zeros are still available
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
Probably not
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
I mean you could also do it with a garage door opener for 1/20th the price
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
So it took about a week to ship. Just curious on shipping etas thats all. If you cant cancel Im sure you can always resell it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
Oh, yes, buying some ... Let's say niche products outside of us is usually expensive as hell! 

u/DaMrKush : try to buy it from lab401.com when in stock. It'll be still expensive, but holy shit does it have to be better than 360!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
Legit the time it took to receive this product I figured out how to do this with a RaspberryPi for 1/2 the price.

Shipping is $88 or $130 express to Canada?!  This drove me here to see if anyone else finds this insane?

Awesome, thanks so much!

I ordered one a week ago but caught one on eBay yesterday for $175 so I grabbed that.

Are there any mail forwarding services in surrounding countries? That could potentially work out to being cheaper although I dont know how import fees work over there

If you do this via "Add manually" - yes, you'll be able to pair it

If you do this by capturing an existing signal from a fob - it won't work and you'll de-sync the original fob


So just create a new Security+ file via "Add manually" and pair it as you would any other remote, and it should work fine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
I just ordered mine a few days ago. I want mine now lol 
I also ordered mine from the site instead of paying twice the price on eBay. 
I am going to assume its going to be maybe a month until I get mine. I would recommend to rubber case. 
I did see a few on eBay for around the same price. Id go ahead and just order one just so youll have one. 
You have a case for your phone? Yeah.

I don't think the OTG cable is an option, because the flipper can't act as a USB host, if I'm not mistaken.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
Great point
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
It is being worked on AFAIK.  Some custom FW have already played around with an early version of it.  Essentially Games and Plugins got replaced with FAP files that go into an apps folder on the SD.  You would launch each FAP file from a FAP Loader app in the menu, showing whatever you put in the apps folder.

It was kinda cool but the FW I am running went back to compiling apps &amp; plugins with FW again, I am guessing until it is a bit more fleshed out.

Honestly it's hard to tell if it hit all cores. Because CPU goes from 2% idle to 5% when it's running.
I can notice a little activity on the threads, especially the first 12. But on the other 12, task manager doesn't help.

Do you have any tips how to check threads on a windows app?

I only know Linux for stuff like this
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10

Yeah the direct orders from the site right now are individually shipped, and very expensive. The Kickstarter batch was shipped as a batch and is individually far cheaper
-------------------------------

I would be shocked if the Flipper One is for sale a year from now. And it's not even the same kind of device.

Flipper One isn't an upgraded model, it will serve an entirely different purpose. Flipper One is going to be a WiFi penetration testing tool

I am thinking about buying another one anyway. What a great excuse.

I have two of them now. I connected two different computers and used the Linux utility tio to connect. 

It acts like a chat channel in that when I type at one, it displays at the other provided you're in the chat. The requirement to be in receive mode seems a limitation. 

When the receiver gets the message, it displays in the cli and also vibrates the toy. 

I'll try to duplicate and send a transcript later. I'm interested in making this functionality available from the interface but not sure the best way to proceed. I'd love to find others who want to work on this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
u/awesomefacepalm It does hit all cores though right? It asks for how many logical cores the system has and creates that many paralleled pool spaces. So it should hit all cores, zip bombs are more about disk IO then CPU, If I wanted to hit the CPU harder I would add my folder and file bombs to spam the system and start spawning rickrolls as a distraction.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-10
I have loaded it a few times up, but I dont think anyone near me is using a flipper as I have not seen any activity.

Well, they are separate, Wi-Fi goes to the right side gpio nrf to the right. Only 3v3 from both of them going to the switch, and from the switch to gpio. Simple as that.

As we are preparing the batch shipments at the moment, all new orders will be shipped directly to the customer instead of as part of a larger batch, which I'm afraid is simply quite expensive as it's an insured shipment of a device containing a battery.

Agreed. A couple look like they are hardly making connection. Others look like too much solder. My suggestions for something like this, veroboard or perfboard with the in line tracks. Also wire wrapping wire for the data lines. Thinner wire and can look a bit more professional for spaghetti. This all being said I hadn't thought of this and will be taking inspiration for my flipper.

Yeah maybe we'll get some documentation someday that'll help.

I haven't even had the chance to look at it yet but I guess there's a good enough chance they're using something proprietary enough. 

I wish I had a TX capable SDR. Someday!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
I tried analyzing the signal with Universal Radio Hacker, but I have no idea where to start tbh. (There's also SignalAnalyzer and SigDigger which should also work)

URH also transmits, so with a tx-capable sdr you could at least echo messages back at your flipper with no extra effort. Reverse engineering the system to allow computer-to-flipper communication would be nice though!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09

Something like this could be implemented as a GPIO module.

It allows basic UART communication (plus uses the Flipper as a battery.) As to what you would use it for Ive seen some people do a few things in Discord but nothing major.

Fantastic - wasnt sure if there was more added to support anything in the code.

And you are correct - its a known issue that hot swapping the 3.3V can cause issues with the SD. The devboard especially! Good call on the 5V. Plus Moar Power!!
-------------------------------

I almost doubt there's another flipper in my entire state. :(

I did play with it a bit though just the other day with my handheld radio. Just heard static when tuned to the frequency and sending a message. 

I could probably pull the text from the air with my SDR, but I haven't tried anything yet with that route.

1 : 2022-08-09
I would LOVE to know how you worked out the adapter for the wifi module and the nrf module! Im taking notes and zooming in now! I just fixed the nrf to mine but Ive been switching between the wifi module and nrf dying for a combo so I can use them both but not interchangeably! This is awesome

I just got Marauder to work with the flipper and I serial into the dev board thru the flipper to use the dev board.

Do u use urs the same way? I have the default firmware on the flipper.

Also got the board for mouse jack attacks just need a guide and to solder it up

code is at [https://github.com/Timmotools/flipperzero\_esp8266\_deautherv2](https://github.com/Timmotools/flipperzero_esp8266_deautherv2)

Wiring is the same as you have for the esp8266. wired for 13/14 TX/RX. I had it connected to 3.3v before but now run it on 5V switched from the FZ. apparently hotswapping stuff on the 3.3v rail can cause issues with SD card. I hadnt have it happen to me but saw it on a thread either here or on facebook.

Actually  they're  using for what it's used for but it's even more beyond it's stock abilities.

Perfect , used lowercase and now its in alphabetical order
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
I tried that , Maybe because of the Capital A , so if I used alphabetical order in lowercase it should list how I think
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
So the wire-mess of a board on the back is really just a simple adapter so the WiFi module sits on the back of the flipper instead of extending over the top.    
The additional mess is an afterthought to allow mounting the NRF24 (2.4Ghz) Module.    


The purpose is to extend the functionality of the Flipper with additional hardware and different firmware.

just to explain that, it's sorted alphabetically and lots of symbols come first in the alphabet. you could also just rename it to amiibo instead of flipperamiibo.

You could do it without it, but also theres no way to operate both of them from flipper at the same time, so no need to power them both and drain energy.

Thats wonderful!  The flipper zero team truly cares about customer satisfaction and for a company set on disrupting global technology through hacking hardware and software, they're amazing customer service.  
Their company slogan should be "Piracy is a SERVICE problem, not a customer problem".

Tim, you're a real sweetheart &lt;3

Reading this genuinely made me happy, it really means a lot to me.  
Thank you a ton for the sweet words, this was amazing to read after a long day of work.

Fingers crossed the mailman doesn't use your package as a punching bag this time!

Zoe, thank you for being a wonderful Flipper representative!  It's great customer service that makes me want to continue supporting these kinds of projects!

-------------------------------

You can create or move any folders youd like using the qFlipper firmware when you connect to your PC or Mac. Aside from that, there is the mobile app you can connect to to view and edit folders over Bluetooth but Im not sure about moving/creating using this. Can update when Im able to test later.

It will open if the car is "awake", independent of door lock status. If the car is parked long enough without activity, it can go into a sleep mode to conserve the battery, during which the signal no longer works. Many owners use sentry mode in public, which records video around the car when close motion is detected, and it prevents the car from going to sleep.

It will close itself in a minute or two if it doesn't detect a charger connect.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
I think so
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
Those are in the discord no?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
No there are different firmwares.
Look for the "Awesome Flipper" Github repo. It contains different firmwares to try out. Each of them is not an official release but they are packed with good add ons, games and some minor tweaks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
Is that the Latest firmware update?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
have fun with it! Enjoy it :D Don't overdo it tho. 
From my experience, less Teslas will spawn nearby from the point of being able to do this prank

[https://github.com/SequoiaSan/FlipperZero-Wifi-ESP8266-Deauther-Module](https://github.com/SequoiaSan/FlipperZero-Wifi-ESP8266-Deauther-Module)  


Maybe will help you with the ESP8266 that you already have.

One could also modify the flipper and marauder firmware to write the packet data to cli and save it on flipper SD.
-------------------------------

I found the files [here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Sub-GHz/Vehicles/Tesla/433_Tesla_AM650_EU_AUS.sub)
I am in the European region so if you're in the US, you need to find a different file. They're included in the RogueMaster Firmware tho
-------------------------------

As far as I know, the wifi dev board can't access the sd card of the flipper zero. The mod is needed if you want to save captures you made with the marauder firmware.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
My apologies to the flippers 0 team for the above comment my son wrote it as he was very annoyed and upset the device was broken . He did not quite realise what was going on.

To put it bluntly I cannot speak highly enough of Zoe and the flipper team . They have been very kind and listening to me and understanding my issue and have come to the conclusion that it was obviously damaged in transit due to the state it was in when it arrived. Zoe has been nothing but professional kind and courteous with me and has made the whole process very easy and stress free. As a result of this they are going to replace my device with a brand new device of exactly the same colour and will log a claim with their shipping provider which is fair enough considering the state the parcel was in when I received it.

These guys are by far the best and most active people I have dealt with in regards to support assistance troubleshooting or anything they always reply fairly quickly and always do everything they can to resolve things as quickly as possible as for the flipper device sadly mind is dead but it looks very well built and very solid and I'm sure when I get my replacement it will be brilliant cannot recommend buying from this company enough after sales support is amazing a product is fantastic and yeah let's hope my replacement gets to me undamaged by the evil postman 

Tim

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
Hey this isn't true at all :(

You reached out to us saying that your Flipper wasn't functional, and I mentioned we would be happy to replace it but will need additional information to do so. Since we don't work during the weekends, I simply hadn't had time to respond to your email from Saturday.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
An indirect way of doing this could be using the mobile app archive and writing a shortcut
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
Use r/flippersales.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-09
Yeah and could modify a current model to make it fit.

Eventually I'll run this on version 3 of the deauth tool. Right now version 3 does not support Web interface or lcd/buttons. Serial only. Bit hard to have it in a smaller form factor when you need it tethered to a PC or phone all the time. Still running version 2 on this as I was only using flipper to power it.

1 : 2022-08-09
As far as I understand it, as of now that "shut off signal" is only for THAT specific robot. The serial number is encoded in the transmission to specify the target. I've heard a certain group of* "set free" * developers are working on a way to brute force a universal command.

How long did they take to replace it? Unfortunately mine broke and Im waiting three weeks or more for anything to happen. My ticket was lost last time I checked.

This was due to voltage drop or spike, when you run the wifi dev board without the 5v gpio on. The 3.3v gpio shares voltage with the sdcard.

&gt; costs where *paid* beforehand?

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*

On any Unix based operating system, such as OSX, a filename that begins with a . (dot) is treated as a hidden file. Under normal operation you don't see this file, but the flipper zero is showing all files, hidden or not, so it is always present on the SD card but it's only visible when viewed by a system that is showing hidden files. The reason this file is created is probably to do with indexing, caching,  or to retrieve deleted files from the trash can or undelete feature

Would be surprised Cambio still uses 125 KHz cards.  More probably 13.56 MHz card.  Fair chance it is a Mifare.  Easy way to check if your phone supports NFC is NXP's Taginfo app, or similar NFC tools.

The PS terminal is killed before anything is downloaded. Probably some permission issues

Read the ducky, it includes an exclusion to the download/extract folder that is system32. In my testing I came across win defender flagging it and killing the process. So I added that exclusion and it works just fine on a fully updated win10 system.

Got this off of git:  


"Do you hotplug wifi module?  
  
3.3v ext shared with sd card, abnormal load spikes may cause DCDC to reset power, which is causing SD reset.  
In general it's better to enable 5V-ext and not to hotplug wifi module."

Trying 5v enabled in GPIO and not hotplugging.

After you connect your WiFi Dev board in boot loader mode (holding power and hitting reset) it will show up as a com port on your computer. Once you select it in the IDE, and make sure the partition is correct, you should mash upload and it will compile the Marauder boot loader software and upload it to the dev board. Once that completes successfully reboot your dev board.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point is when you should see your MarauderOTA and be able to connect with justcallmekoko. Connect and navigate to [192.168.4.1](https://192.168.4.1). Here you enter admin/admin and upload the esp32 Marauder firmware .bin you downloaded.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done this at least four times and the process can be repeated several times if needed. With no lights on the board, if it's after you've compiled in IDE and successfully uploaded (100% and hash verification), you probably just need to reboot it to see the MarauderOTA.
-------------------------------

Flipper aside, I always thought pokemon could make use of that tech. Either as an add-on to the old DS's or as a standalone tomogachi kind of think.  


Walk around to grow and evolve your poekemon and scan random barcodes to generate wild pokemon to fight/capture.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-08
Awesome! Let me know if it works/if you run into any issues:)

That could be super cool if you are up for trying to record more data. A couple notes:

1) it's hard to get full recordings (more than some number under ~30 samples displayed on the Flipper after 
2) there's actually a lot of IR traffic between songs, and sometimes none during songs--presumably they do most of the effects by queueing up the effects before songs and then they trigger them all to run. We're probably only a subset of the IR commands (the ones with immediate effects). Still great to get more base packet structures in general though!

Maybe I will put a folder of the first IR recordings into the repo, and then we could add yours to that (via a fork/PR if you use GitHub or by sending them to me and having me upload them if you don't).

Thanks so much! I'm sure the show will be great.

It will open if the car is "awake", independent of door lock status. If the car is parked long enough without activity, it can go into a sleep mode to conserve the battery, during which the signal no longer works.

Many owners use sentry mode in public, which records video around the car when close motion is detected, and it prevents the car from going to sleep. Sentry mode and time since last activity, not lock state, is the most likely cause of difference in behavior.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-08
Ya look for the brand name, model number. If you see any stickers on it with info. 

Obviously writing on the card in reference to something. 

You can search from there online and post it in the flipper zero forums for them to add.

The easiest portable way to scan barcodes is with a mobile phone camera with a barcode scanner app. If you're using iOS I'd recommend QRafter, this can scan a lot of 1D and 2D barcodes, and also keeps a history of your scans.

I normally run this everytime after I copy stuff to the SD card:

find /Volumes/&lt;FLIPPER\_SDCARD\_NAME&gt; -name '.\_\*' -type f -delete

Replace &lt;FLIPPER\_SDCARD\_NAME&gt; with your SD card name. This will find and delete all files starting with ".\_" on the SD card. It works for me :)

You can run the command without the "-delete" to confirm the files to be deleted.

Cheers!

Agreed. There was a man that did this a few years back to prevent people from using their phones while on his commute to work. The FCC got wind of this and tracked down the man responsible. Once they found him, they hit him with a $235,000 fine. So I wouldn't recommend doing it. It's not at all worth it.

Yea they were alot of fun, ahead of it's time
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
With the base device, no. If you want to make a module using the GPIO pins, then that could be possible. I wouldn't advise this, jamming phones could get you to serious trouble with the FCC, because it would block emergency calls.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
The flipper does not have a camera/code scanner but over GPIO you could build a module to scan barcodes and maybe even QR Codes.  
Would be sick to bring back such a cool thing. I think the Skannerz never really made it to Germany but I saw a video about these on YT

No the flipper zero operates on an entirely different frequency to mobile phones. Also, a jammer such as you are describing is illegal and you can get yourself a nice case of imprisonment if you do happen to buy and use one.

No. But you should probably tell your friend, using a frequency jammer is against fcc law. Fcc is federal which would mean huge trouble if caught

*monsters I'm sorry
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
Well, actually yes, it's a full firmware update each time I need to try something :_ D

I basically run a `./fbt --with-updater COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 updater_package` each time I wanna test a new build and then I push it via serial connection (with the companion app) using the file manager. After installing the new firmware I'll test it and iterate over and over again.

It's kinda tedious but in the end I just try to check small batches of changes everytime, which seems to work for this project (probably in bigger stuff it'll be more challenging, ofc).

The hardest part to debug (at least for me) was the GUI-elements position. It was easy to write the logic on my own machine to test "the conversion basics", but when it comes to display certain pixels and use it's own drawing functions there was no shortcut: just some trial and error until everything looked "fancy".
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
Not on iPhone. When you try the Apple Pay screen keeps coming up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
Thank you!

Regarding the multi-converter thing (DEC / BIN / HEX / maybe OCTAL?), I've thought about it and I'll probably do something soon (or at least I'll try :D).

My biggest concern here is about the GUI: I'm not an expert when it comes to design stuff-on-the-screen and I think having three or more "rows" on the display (one for each unit) could be difficult to manage if you need to combine it with a "persistent keyboard" too.

Got a couple ideas about some "contextual menus" and stuff like that, but need a little bit of time to prototype and check the stuff...

*Urdik.*  
I'm not even joking.  I know the device is a penetration tester, but c'mon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-07
Thank you! : D

Regarding the 7 characters thing, it was a work in progress thing that ended up in the final version : P

I started poking with 10-digits numbers and reached the max int limit, so I cut it to 7 to keep testing and that's what ended up appearing in the "first release".

I've just uploaded a small fix with a 9-digit max-size; since the max unsigned int value there is 4294967295 (32 bits uint) I've added a new threshold up to 999999999 (9-digits) but I think it could be adjusted up to the 4294967295 max size with some extra checks...

Accessing qFlipper over ssh requires x forwarding, which means your client must have a graphical environment. Fztea on the other side makes the flipper accessible directly in the terminal. 

But generally speaking, you don't need any custom software. I just had a lot of fun writing it and wanted to share it because someone might like it, too.

1 : 2022-08-07
Unfortunately, Alt codes don't work on Linux and Mac. 

Linux and Mac have an alternative, but A) these codes are triggered with CTRL+SHIFT+U (and the "U" key isn't always the same depending on the keyboard layout), and the code itself is hexadecimal meaning you need the letters A through F as well which also differ from layout to layout. 

Too bad there isn't an alternative HID mode for keyboards where they can just send unicode characters to the OS instead of key presses.

Im a super early bird backer, mine looks fine, I havent tried the IO ports yet however. But other than that I havent noticed anything  wrong.

And the device itself is worth it if you like to tinker with radio signals, nfc, infrared, etc. And if you know about electronics. If thats not the case... since it does not have built-in wifi or the likes of metasploit in it... it might be an overpriced toy that will end up in your drawer.

Using it as USB-UART bridge might be nice but for that you can buy a Chinese 2$ dongle.

Its a small open source hacking multitool which you can program yourself.

Its great for people interested in messing with wireless protocols and want to get into programming embedded devices like this as the code is open source and the community in the discord channels is active and helping new users to onboard on building on the platform

Its not really a plug and play device at its current state and you should not expect it being a 1 click do all hacking device

Had the same (38 eur customs). It's a fun toy, but I honestly regret having bought the flipper for what it cost. Definitely overpriced for what it is.
-------------------------------

Well.. proxmark is best for this kind of job but if you don't wanna buy it, well, either wait for the support to be added (although it should already support hid) or get your hands dirty and go mess with the code although that will require some expertise so you oughta learn a lot about it.


Also, if your phone has NFC, try see if your phone can detect it.

[GitHub repo (checkout extend_keyboard branch)](https://github.com/edrethardo/flipperzero-firmware)

I didnt like that I couldnt add lists to Wi-Fi marauder and + - to remote buttons. So I added the functionality to use multiple keyboards.

Its forked from Eng1n33rs firmware I initially wanted to build it on unleashed but at the time the main branch of the repo was broken.

I plan to add the remote icons from the Remote app. 
I have a week of vacation in 2 weeks. as this mod just took around an hour with debugging Im certain I can finish the icon board in short time.

No, that would put it in the bootloader mode


They just need to boot the firmware for the wifi network to appear, not the bootloader

May you elaborate why you chose the route of soldering an SD card slot to the WI-FI dev board instead of choosing the Software route of sending the Data to the flipper and it writing it to its SD card?

Thank you, that's about the extent of what I can do
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-06
Yeah I'm sorry, I still need to set up the CI to automatically build the firmware when I push new code. For now, I manually created [a pre-release](https://github.com/Dabolus/flipperzero-firmware-rpg/releases/tag/nightly-2022-08-06T2240) on GitHub, so that at least you don't have to build the firmware on your local machine by yourself. To flash it, make sure you have installed the latest version of the RogueMaster firmware and then flash the .dfu provided in my pre-release using qFlipper!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-06
Just do it!

Seriously, if you have some experience in programming making small tweaks is going to be fun. The only issue is getting used to the code base itself and to how the Flipper works, but once that's done, the tweaks are going to be quite easy to implement. The great thing is that if you chase this path you are going to get to know the Flipper more and more!

If you do not have any experience in programming, of course I wouldn't suggest starting by editing a firmware. Start with the basics of the C language and with the fundamentals of programming languages/how computers work in general. In the end, once you get into the programming mindset, switching between languages and devices is going to be a breeze.

As a practical example, I'm a web developer, so I work in a completely different field, but I started doing these small edits to the Flipper firmware and in parallel I started implementing [my portfolio](https://giorgio.garasto.me/en/) in the form of a [Game Boy game](https://github.com/Dabolus/portfolio-cartridge). If I can do it, then everyone can. You just need to get into the mindset, be passionate, and let your imagination flow!

The Xbox DVD remote also functions as a super limited controller, so I don't know if that is also a factor. Weirdly enough, the Mission Impossible Game Boy Color game can also copy and send IR codes through the GBC IR port. It has no problem with the remote  I never watch DVD's on the Xbox anyways, was just a curiosity test
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-06
I had a similar issue when dumping a remote for an old VCR - the good news is that it shouldn't really matter.

I'm guessing the flipper recognizes some IR codes and knows when to stop receiving, but for unrecognized codes it just keeps going. If you have the device the remote is for you can verify that the commands still work - the only potential issue is that if you do it for too long you might transmit two button presses for some commands.

I'm conviced I tried any combination of plugging in and holding buttons. But today it started working when I held boot during plugging in, and using the flipper as a UART bridge with a 115200 baudrate.

* Increased the total number of levels from 3 to 255, with the XP thresholds computed dynamically. For initial levels, it's much easier to level up (kinda like in Pokmon)
* Added the current XP/required XP for next level in the form of text
* Added much more moods (by default you have 14 "butthurt" levels on the FW, but then the moods are only 3. Instead, I added a mood for each "butthurt" level). You can see it from my Flipper's mood, which is now Joyful, that doesn't exist on standard FW
* Added the gender of the Flipper, computed based on Flipper's unique name

I told you they were useless lol, but I haven't been using C/C++ since high school. I'm starting using them again now and I just wanted to have some fun. I have to admit I was surprised by how easy it easy to customize the FW tbh

Well, this way, it's a nice and quick read!

jokes aside, everything is still in early stage. Couple days ago I tried a 'make-an-app' tutorial. The code was updated a week ago, but it was already out of date and couldn't be compiled against the official source code. 

There's seriously a lot of work done, and even in core of the source, loads of things are being improved and moved. To write a high end manual for the flipper would be useless work, as so much is still changing, you'd constantly would have to change the manual as well, creating double work. And I am lazy, so I understand that they wait a bit.

Hold my beer.  
I am located in Georgia (country) and was able to order flipper only from Lab401 in France. They do not have delivery to Georgia, and I had forward it via my friend.  
This means:  


* 48 euro tax in Netherland
* 95 euro for additional DHL delivery
* 41 euro tax in Georgia. (also most probably +20 GEL ( \~ 7.25 euro for processing)  


\~ 191 euro overall, and flipper is still on customs clearance for more than a week, so I even had not got it.

I successfully read and emulated my wristband at the PA location back in May.  I checked it by unlocking the room door, and making purchases in the coffee shop.  According to my flipper it read as: Mifare Ultralight NFC-A, SAK: 00 ATOA:4400.  Im running the 0.58.1 firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-06
I had similar struggle last night and finally was able to flash it correctly. I'm new to ESP32 and I wasn't aware it need to be started in bootloader mode. If you just connect it to PC you will red LED on board and two COM ports on PC. In bootloader mode, no LED and one COM port. I had to load drivers for ESP32-S2 which was unrecognized, but then Arduino IDE had no problem to write code to board.

You need to be sure it's in bootloader mode (boot button need to be pressed when connecting cable)

Do you see correct USB devices when connecting board to PC? (you should see one additional COM port and ESP32-S2 device)

Nice, the device definitely isnt capable of doom but most likely of a lower spec Doom rework or very laggy doom.

1 : 2022-08-06
Very slight correction: You *can* potentially damage your flipper if you modify the firmware to allow you to transmit outside its hardware capabilities.

I dont mean disable the legal limitations I mean intentionally alter the transmission range within the firmware.

Apparently, the hardware *may* be designed in such a way that it cant handle those frequencies.

Thanks, tbh wish I had the time. Working two jobs, got a 3 year old at home also.... Might get on this once he grows up a little more, and I can get some more time to myself. 

Definitely one of my goals is to make a digimon/fighting vpet kinda game.

I remember seeing something a few weeks ago that there was a bug in the official branch that broke the ultralight application. Since its reading the first stage its possible that your running one of the affected builds if you have a phone with NFC support try the NXP NFC TagInfo app, its free and will tell you what kind of tag it is for sure.
-------------------------------

Gotcha. Seems like you know more than I do
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
And how can u mess with that? By sending the same signal someone near would generate?

Good to know! How often would I need to check in on it and top it off?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
That price point alone makes me want it, even if for carrying other items

just wanna throw this out there for this thread 
u/LoveMyMomThrow

u/texlonhacker 

iso15693 emulation will most likely remain a non-starter because the ST25RFAL002 library doesnt have any existing support for NFC-V emulation. so adding it would entail creating library support on the low low chip level and not as simple as creating iso14443a emulation which has pre-existing chip support
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
congrats! you just de-synced your keys!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Maybe, but it will be quite some work.

Distance with ultrasonic sensors is based on tof. To detect something moved away, you need a much longer tof than the echo bouncing off a urinator.

Which means you'll have to capture each ultrasonic tweet independently and somehow prevent it from bouncing off the human. While said human is pissing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Most use ultrasonic or ir to detect when someone is near for a while, then goes away
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Thanks man. Raspberry Pis are fun, but this looks like it has so much more out of the box. I have already started looking at the firmware and am seeing what I might be able to do with it before the flipper gets here.
-------------------------------

How we can code flipper?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
trail and error
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
There is a 'BUTTHURT' function in the firmware where you can change the entire threshold for how your Flipper views your interactions. Kudos to you for your advice though, dude. A lot of times in the sub-reddit people lose their shit and don't get the point of the device. You nailed it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Impossible to do, dude. There are a few threads here and in the Discord identifying where the 'BUTTHURT' function is in the code. You can tinker and re-flash all day long and you cannot brick your Flipper. It's designed to be resilient and accept a clean flash from qFlipper no matter how fucked your code change might be. Honestly? It's pretty much been one of my favorite dev sandboxes for that reason. If you want to beat on C and learn to code this is your device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
It can happen, but quite a few cars still use an on-board procedure to sync it again. In the case of a large number of Toyota vehicles, the procedure is to open and close the drivers door multiple times, and pull they key in/out of the ignition, so it's not a big issue. Proximity and semi-smart keys are en issue though, as they need a diagnostic tool hooked up to the obd port to program.

125 kHz supports Ukraine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Was trial and error for me. If you find the correct modulation, it will show a large thick bar on the reading, whereas the wrong modulation either doesn't read at all, or shows thin spikes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05

What's the IP rating (if you know it)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
That is understandable. I don't suppose you are going to Defcon are you? I know there is possibly a meet up for flippers there but the hardware hacking I'll age could give you some exposure on how to achieve what you are looking at.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
why not in a fridge? is there a risk of spoiling food?
-------------------------------

This will de sync your key fob and they wont work anymore. Be careful.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
There seems to be an issue about this already [in GH](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues/1482).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Im having the exact same problem with Ultralight C.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I looked through the firmware but, honestly, I'm wary of changing anything in there and bricking my Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I think it's because it's outside its range
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Youd have to pay the button a LOT and not hit it near the car for any of them
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
screen protector is debatable, but you don't need the case. You can drop a flipper zero and it will break the floor instead of the device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Depends on several factors, since the flipper can read password protected cards if you know the key and it's in the dictionary, plus the format needs to be one that the flipper supports. 

I've got a few cards that I know the pass to due to a brute force attack with a proxmark, however the flipper can't emulate them yet as there is no support yet. 

Also note that a single building can have multiple card types that it recognizes but the flipper can't emulate, so try different keys if you have multiples. 

There are scripts to convert Proxmark formatted card dumps to Flipper format, but the flipper still needs to understand how to emulate, and the flipper needs to be able to get the timing correct at the very least.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I'm not going to lie, it would be a slow and frustrating start but if you've retained  enough knowledge to scrape together (and understand) a hello world you will be in a good position!
There's a decent 'barebones' app tutorial/example online that I used to get my head around how to write code specifically for the Flipper but I can't find it right now - I'll try and drop it in here later. 

It might be a bit much for you to start with, but I don't think you'd need more than a few weeks of studying and writing basic C/C++ programs to get there. I believe in you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I just recently ordered mine but given that the firmware is released, have you considered trying to modify and customize your setup? It might be as simple as replacing the pngs for the angry/grim faces with something you like more. Or perhaps you can find where that feature is enabled in the code and add a configuration to enable/disable it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
The VPet feature is still very rudimentary as the devs have bigger fish to fry at the moment. It will be improved in time however :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Aww shii~
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Okay
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I am using the official firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
The card I am trying to read is an Ultralight C card.
-------------------------------

I don't believe so.

I learnt in school, qbasic, vbasic, some C++, java, html and some Cobalt. How to make a RNG dice in excel.... But not enough to write anything by myself.......and this was over 25 years ago.... So it's kinda over my head now.... Might be able to do a hello world program...LOL.... But that's kinda it.... I mean it's a skill I would love to pick up again and have tried..... but.... Right now can't code to save my life!

I hate to be that guy but have you considered learning how to code?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I can't say for certain, but it's likely a software limitation, it may be added in the future, but you'd have to ask the devs to be sure.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Thanks.    
I just tried that with different serial adapters and the flipper itself.     
I also tried lowering the baudrate to 115200.    


Unfortunately no luck, i see bursts of data going out on the TX line (as expected) but the esp32 does not seem to respond.

Im just used to it from other devices.  After I did it wrong, I did it right without thinking.

Experience is what you get immediately *after* you needed it.
-------------------------------

Thats really amazing already! Hope one day u have the time to get it done! Really wish I could code!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Ah then you are all in that realm then, you probably know my work with the alpha apps and minor portions in w0rld. I know the flipper has some love in the community but only for people that already have other more technical interests.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
It was confirmed to be an issue with a certain unofficial firmware. A fixed was released last night. Seems to be resolved now.

Dunno what caused it, but i think what you're saying is likely.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Yup, thanks for asking. I found an older video of some random indian guy to find out about how to access that mode on an ESP32 board by pure luck. How did you find out about it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Yeah, if they got the code and maybe a new module addon, I think the flipper would be loved by many in the digimon community! I actually have the beta and alpha link devices for the phone and pc, also I used to play the digimon unlimited mobile version. Hope some one here with coding skills and time is a digimon fan too! Would love to see it implemented.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
That's great, thanks for that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I've started work on a Digimon punching bag but that's about it - full implementation of the code floating around would be a pretty big job
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Yep, made that mistake as well.  

Get yours going?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
You can use the USB-UART bridge in the flipper's GPIO app to use the flipper as a USB adapter for the board's UART
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
yaaas
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
Ah. That makes sense. Thank you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
It means that it recognizes that the card is present but doesn't understand its data format

If someone uses a Proxmark to copy a card like this, is it possible to put the file onto the flipper and use the flipper to emulate it? Even though the flipper couldn't actually create the copy?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
I assume this would happen if I click the key too much out off range and the key is too far ahead of the car? Am I correctly assuming that they resync everytime I open the car with the key in range?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
there is currently a arduino version of this and there is a lot that goes into it but has been adapted pico so im sure it can be done on the flipper but i dont think the dev has much interest in porting their code and remaking the circuit design for a device that isnt big in the digimon community yet. 

Might be able to write a serial interface that communicates with the arduino though and read and save off digiRoms (the code that the device produces to send to other people). ive written a few apps that do it but none of that code would work on the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05

Haven't come across it, but I saw someone who made the original Tamagotchi app for flipper https://github.com/GMMan/flipperzero-firmware/tree/tama-p1/applications/tamagotchi\_p1
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
It's password-protected, so the flipper can't read it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-05
You'd need a proxmark for this, most likely. I have some similar armbands, and they use 15693 tags from Texas Instruments. If that's what yours is, the good news is the data can easily be read, as the tags have no security, other than the serial number is hard coded. You'd still need a proxmark3 or USB reader that supports 13.56 MHz

Radios have "birdie" frequencies. Internal frequencies, maybe the reference crystal oscillator or an intermediate frequency or a harmonic. You usually filter those out of scans. Maybe you're seeing one that hasn't been filtered, maybe uniquely strong for your particular device.

The Flipper uses a LiPo battery. The best way to store one longer-term is to (dis)charge it to around 3.6-3.8V (50-60%), turn it off and keep it as cold as possible. 20 C is fine, 10 C is better.

This will ensure you're not losing too much battery capacity over time. Keeping it fully charged will damage the battery more quickly.
-------------------------------

When it comes the resin affecting the communications, I don't think it should, I'm not 100% sure about the RFID/NFC (doubt it since phone cases don't affect its ability to read/transmit NFC), but the subghz shouldn't be affected in any noticeable way.

Considering the cost of an entire amiibo collection, getting a flipper zero + downloading the amiibo NFC files cost less than actually going out of your way to buy said amiibo collection. Also, it's nintendo so it's morally correct to pirate their products.

Thanks for all the help everyone. I was able to identify the freq, but unfortunately I wont be able to program the feng to monitor it. The freq was in the 300s, which is out of the range that I can monitor. I see I can get a used radio for under $100 and might try that, but all the info you shared really helped me figure out a lot. If I get a different radio I will use the tips to just copy the programming and make mine a clone.

Looking at the ifixit teardown page for the flipper zero you can take the battery out if you want to, while looking I found out that the flipper zero uses a Litium ion battery.

Charge or discharge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity before storage.
Charge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity at least once every six months.
Remove the battery and store it separately from the product.
Store the battery at temperatures between 5 C and 20 C (41 F and 68 F).

yes, parallels win11 m1 mac. i just installed it into my parallels win11 image and the drivers won't install and i'm getting the same 'unknown' under board info and failure to connect that i'm getting in mac. i think this is a doomed project although i've put like 12 solid hours of googling possible solutions by now and gotten nowhere except i fixed python and xcode along the way.

I did it running windows 11 on an amd cpu. Are you emulating windows on an m1 Mac or something? I tried that and couldnt get it to work lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
they only have a win10 version, not win11. it made me mad i couldn't download it onto the mac--evidently i have to access it from windows. that's about the only option i have left though. i installed one of the two drivers and i suspect that will break my radios i need to config. but i think i know where i can get the original driver just in case. /guy

If I remember right, the drivers are so that the program you use to install the firmware can communicate with the device itself. I used windows.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
i too am failing when it tries to write. i wasn't sure whether the mac even needed those drivers and they don't work on the arm chip in any case.

This case looks really good; I recently got my flipper and dev board, and was looking into what is possible, and now that using the [ESP32 Marauder firmware is possible](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/flipper-zero) and documented, there's also a process for adding an SD card breakout for the saving of PCAP files. Would this case still work with that, or would it need some significant modifications to get it to fit?

Probably not, but a good candidate for third-party plugins
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
First of all, you're probably talking about the SD card, not the SIM card

Second, are you sure you're inserting it properly? It might need to be pushed with something like a card to be far enough for the reader to click and hold it in place

1 : 2022-08-04
Mine keeps getting stuck at 468Mhz. Confirmed with other devices (hackrf, rtl-sdr, frequency counter there is nothing showing up on that frequency.  Even miles away I'm still seeing it.

have you tried capturing raw on that frequency or going to another location to see if it shows up still?

True, I'd still recommend the cheap Amazon one just so you A) know for a fact it's wired correctly and won't damage it(unlikely but still) and B) don't have to deal  with a 2nd device when trying to dump it.

Definitely could try it out with programming the baofeng radios tho!

you can probably just DIY the cable if you get the pinout. Use the Flipper as a USB-UART.

If you really want to get into some dumb stuff like this you might as well learn from the best and look up how Jiggaboo Jones had his card stealing setup.

Or just go buy some on the deepweb.

Do you recall which frequencies these were?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
For sure! I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't own it and see for myself how rad it is. When it came out over two years ago it needed some time to bake and sat on my shelf for a while and watching it progress over time from birth till now has been awesome. It's the same thing with the flipper watching it progress week over week. It used to be a literal flaming dumpster fire, but megi put tons of awesome kernel and FW work into it and it's night an day now. Big shout out to megi, mad love! A cheap alt could always be rpi with a display and battery an use one of those little BT brick keyboards. But at that point you might as well just use the rpi for whatever buffoonery you are up to. Or put a kali image on your pinephone, or just buy some actual gear like a pineapple or an opensource ready router an put openwrt on it.

1 : 2022-08-04
According to the company blog on habr, someone did get magspoof functionality working at a hackathon using one of the antennae. 

Not magnetic read or write, but emulation (much more useful for access control tests).

Will this eventually be rolled into the main release firmware?

For informational purposes, of course. You can attach additional components to it either via the Wi-Fi dev board or IOs. 

I dont think theres anything wrong with discussing these things but I dont think its practical. If you are planning on getting into carding there are websites and devices that already exist for that and this would not be a practical place for it.

That video is a year old and development has gone way past that, plus they literally didn't update it when they pulled it out of the box. Look at the firmware the flipper shipped with compared to what it is now. I love Anthony from ltt but holy shit he did that thing dirty. It's an awesome device and more people should switch for the repairability and openness alone. Much less having a full linux arm desktop in your pocket. You can distro hop on a phone from the phone, boot into emmc or sd card and write to one from the other and dual boot into your new distro.

I searched legit uses for card skimmer and not a single thing popped up. So let's not associate nefarious things with the flipper. Also why would you just leave your flipper somewhere? Much less asking something like that with how much documentation there is out there stating otherwise tells us even if it had that capability you wouldn't know what to do with it. I will let you in on some key info as well. I have a friend who has done research into deepweb CC trading rings and even if you were skimming cards all day long and doing 15 cent charges labeled as service fees to go under the radar you will make half of minimum wage. You will be locked up so hard for literal pizza and beer money. Just go get a job at mcdonalds and put the flipper down.

Yes or one log per day with the date as name. In the best case readable and browsable by the flipper. Alternatively if browsing is a problem on file with all the frequencies which can be read by the flipper. Then we don't need the file browsing part. Gre

First of all, can you check the model name (on the front, i.e. GP320), then remove the battery and check the Type and maybe Model. That will tell you if it is a VHF or UHF version of the radio. Then go from there. Use the tool you have: Set the Baofeng to the correct band (VHF/UHF) and then let it scan while transmitting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
It has all four contacts so I would assume its data capable. Otherwise they would be wasting material.

The frequency range seems to be 134.2 kHz frequency, 125 kHz low frequency and 860 MHz to 960 MHz  


So that should be supported by the C1101 chip, not sure about the kHz range but since RFID is working fine at 126kHz I don't expect that to be an issue for the hardware at all
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
either way though, that Motorola is transmitting in the VHF or UHF bands, depending on the model, it's one of the other.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-04
Probably should/would not transmit with that radio's antenna too close to your flipper.  
The radio might be pushing 1-4watts , which is a lot more than most 'consumer' devices.  


Why does it only show channels?  
\- This is because those radios are commercial licensed devices, they are programmed via a supplier/vendor to specific frequencies that the business is allowed to utilize.

Fellow Kiwi here, also an OG backer from years ago - mine showed up yesterday. I wouldve been absolutely gutted if mine turned up DOA - Im so sorry dude. Have you tried the suggestions in this thread? Battery connector or something?

Sorry man hope this gets sorted.

what language did you develop it?
-------------------------------

Wasn't there something about a chance of the battery cable to get disconnected?

Not sure where/when I saw it, dunno if it was a during shipping thing, or what, but maybe try checking out the ifixit page, pop it open and check the connector.

Actually I was a baka who backed the project on Kickstarter and have been waiting longer than anybody we were the last two received hours in the rest of the world match for some reason New Zealand did not get attached to the Australian shipment which was crap so yes like you I have had to wait for a very very long time what I meant by months waiting is my back it has said it was shipping for the last several months I have waited eagerly to get this and it arrives and it's completely dead . I've tried resetting it and everything tried different USB cables different power points but nothing works it's a dud now I'm worried I'm going to have to wait for God knows how long to get a replacement so gutted

It's possible they are digital and a baofeng couldn't listen to them. Motorola would likely be mototrbo, which a DMR digital radio would be able to hear. It's also likely they are using business band, and you could check what frequencies they are licensed for by checking on the FCC website.

Do you know what model radios they are?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
IMHO I would get a $25 RTL-SDR on amazon, and just slowly scan through the frequency range your radio can transmit on while keying it up. To find that range, just look up your radio's model number, or it may be printed on the back under the battery. Best of luck!
-------------------------------

This should give you a pretty good overview of the basic capabilities - https://youtu.be/h4x7cGALaC8

Baofengs are notorious for transmitting on harmonic frequencies, so that's probably what your flipper saw
-------------------------------

Just a guess but baud rate? Should be 9600

I get that high level how to do, but is there a video or guide showing how to perform this task?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
Just get one of those cheapie RTL-SDR usb sticks and look at the spectrum waterfall on your PC, will take u like 5 seconds. Pretty handy tool to have in ur kit regardless :)

Eg - https://www.ebay.com/itm/272411458376?epid=22032165355&amp;hash=item3f6cfcfb48:g:H1cAAOSwLMFb~9Qy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
It's likely that they aren't just broadcasting on X frequency, there will be [more info](https://chirp.danplanet.com/download/site/screenshot1.png) you need from the radio if you actually want to decode the broadcast. 

If you use a headset with them, if it was sitting on the table, it likely would just look like you have a headset plugged in and it sitting next to your laptop. It should be as simple as plugging in, selecting com port and hit read. Your work likely has them from a local company that handled the licensing and set up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
Maybe? Im not sure. To be honest, it may be on government frequencies that the feng cant transmit on.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
Might have to look into that. Im not sure work would like that, but it could be possible.
I have no malicious intent, I just want to eaves drop on the radio chatter and have a radio handy if I need to communicate. I dont get a radio daily, just as needed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
Is fixed on 0.63.3

Maybe it does frequency hopping?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
I tried that about a year ago, before I had my flipper, but Im not even sure what frequency to start at, or how to set the steps. 
Kinda hoping someone has tried this. Ill take the flipper to work tomorrow and try to use the freq analyzer
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-03
It would be easier to just plug it into a laptop and dump the config of the radio.  


I believe it is just UART and with a cheap pack of [universal cables from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MIRKIT-Baofeng-Programming-Compatible-Radios/dp/B09LD2HCZV) and a free program from *insert radio brand.*

Yeah it's closer to an Arduino. Hardware aside OP has a lot of coding to do if he plans to start from scratch and that's where the real "fun" is going to be. If you want to build something portable and still hack the waves, you can try Deauther by Spacehuhn, it's for WiFi not RF, IR, etc; but, there are plenty of how to's out there and can be built fairly cheap, cost me under 20 bucks with Amazon parts, even cheaper if you order from AliExpress or whatever, but your flipper will prob be here before then if you order from AliExpress. Anywho, the reason I think this is a worthwhile project while you wait for your Flipper is that this guy supports GPIO pins. In theory, with some coding experience, you'll be able to connect this (or see wifi Marauder) to your Flipper and have it all in one.

It doesn't need flagship hardware, look at just how low end the flippers mcu is and what it can do.

Sure it can run android but why when you can run a full linux destop in your pocket lol.

since the serial cli has subghz communication across flipper devices and there will definitely be flipper owners there, it would seem to be the best time to test out that feature. i assume that this goes unencrypted, so it could be possible to have a way to chat with any setup that allows for that. in a way, it is similar to a lora communication device, but that is usually encrypted and a mesh network.

Where is everyone's hacker spirit?   The platforms are different yes, but the desired outcome might be the same .  You can do whatever you want friend and should. Here is how I would go about this. 

*  Define what your must have features
*  Review your current inventory of stuff you have laying around
*  Ask yourself if those features match your inventory. 

If yes

Build. 

If no

Build something anyway while you wait.

I personally would rather work with other owners on existing projects, helping with problems or selfishly helping me test my own firmware and puzzles.  

I don't want to organize anything, but if someone step up to do that I'll offer up a 10-15 minute talk to kick things off about my own shenanigans and what nuances I've learned through building my own firmware and show how to do some basic and not so basic things.

TL;DR

NFC: completely redesigned application, improvement and NTAG203 support by @GMMan, and much more

SubGhz: bug fixes, new protocols and custom RF presets

Cli: better disconnect handling by @ESurge

Infrared: universal remove loading improvement
Custom toolchain (Windows, Linux, MacOs)

Storage: Internal storage to SD migration tool, improvements

System and tools: improvements and fixes

Even more improvements by contributors

Technically... everything about the board is open source, the schematics, the design for the case/hardware, and the firmware. So technically you could build your own, but it would probably take longer/cost more than just buying it officially and waiting for it to be deliverer. Not with raspberry pis tho, it doesn't run linux, it runs a custom OS (idek if its considered an OS) and a different CPU from the rpi (0/w runs a Broadcom BCM2835) and the flipper runs a arm cortex STM32.

The only thing they really care about is if it's something dangerous, or illegal. Flipper is neither. I don't know what country you're in, but TSA in the US likely wouldn't even think twice. 

I've traveled with a police scanner, laptop, 2 portable radios, cameras, and a shortwave receiver, along with chargers, cords, and extra batteries. No one batted an eye. (All in my carry on)

I seen this question constantly. The answer is you have absolutely nothing to worry about. 

I have personally traveled with mine on multiple occasions with no issues.

What commands do you use for Serial USB terminal? CMD, linux,etc? I downloaded it to use with my Marauder  and not sure how to use the app.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Hmmm.... maybe flattening the face would let it print better face-down.  There's that indented area around the controls, those kind of features get wrecked by support. And if you skip the support will often ruin the print as it can't bridge the whole area.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Yes you can. Its an RFID and I use that in my building as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Lol nobody cares. Have fun on your trip
-------------------------------

There is a big old asterisks there, depends on how many bits are stored on the card, lower security HID tags are supported, but enterprise grade cards (which have more bits of stored data) currently do not work. I have one of those for a clubhouse which I can read and emulate without issue BUT my work badge (Enterprise HID-Indala) can not be read

For that style tag you may need to play with placement a little bit and if you have not rebooted since updating firmware you should try that first. For whatever reason sometimes after update the LF-RFID read does not work right. To get a good read Ive had best luck holding the tag under where the d-pad is. Also dont move it around it can take 5-10 seconds for the read to work and verify.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
I'm going to travel internationally with mine shortly.   I'll let you know how it goes (or not if I end up in detention).

I did "downgrade" to the latest official firmware so in the very, very unlikely event it gets examined further there is nothing remotely incriminating or possibly illegal in any juristriction on it -- though I'm putting some faith in the devs on that.

Great job, welcome to the dark case club!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Yeah, I thought that same thing and have been looking for reasons to buy a resin printer.  Will you buy me one?  


I am bad at the modeling part of this.  So to even build the model itself I did this:

* Grabbed the models here: [https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-3d-models](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-3d-models)
* Cut it in half (well at the connection where screws will hold it together)
* Duplicated the model, set that to 95% or something, tucked it inside the 100% and just removed that space.
* The model is really well done, so in doing that it revealed that all the layers within were still intact.

Then during print I had to CRAAAAANk the temp to 260, flow at 108%, turn off the fan and lay down the fattest layers youve ever seen.  I tried various settings, but could only maintain a glassly look that way.

I tried various print positions, and if I had a glass bed (like my old i3) then id print it face down. 

Face up, i had to add supports, which is why it looks the way it does (im sure you noticed)

I was mainly after trying to get the fit right and hope that someone that is much better than I at this would school me on what im doing wrong.

It'll probably take the color pretty well if you leave it in longer or use a darker shade of dye, I was aiming to cut it short a bit to get the lighter shade, but I would have been ok with all black too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Big oof. 

I'm sorry bro. 

Word of warning, use the best fitting bits you have for the screws and go cautiously. The screws are bad bad and don't take much at all to turn to parmesan cheese.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Yeah I dig the color.  How... tolerant to a change of color do you think the case would be?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
This, but on a resin printer would look legit.  I suppose you'd want it printed with a durable medium.

I only have a Prusa i3 MK2S.  So my transparent PETG is going to look very similar to what you have there.  Mine would probably be at 1.5mm layer height.  Crap, I need to dust that thing off. 

I'll be honest. I'd only attempt what you're talking about, if I had two flippers.  One to potentially break and fix or at least try to.  One for just using.  I'm still waiting on my one.  I also like radio.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
You are right about them spotting what it is. And actually none of the components are illegal, so that shouldn't be a problem, maybe I'm overthinking!

Klingel01.sub definitely does not contain any valid signal recording. I've now verified this with an SDR. You can also upload the .sub and plot its "bits" here: [https://my.flipp.dev/pulse-plotter](https://my.flipp.dev/pulse-plotter)

Klingel02.sub seems to contain something which looks like a signal. But bit timings seem a little off. If you have some spare time and happen to walk by the doorbell TX, would be happy if you could try again.

Hopefully the screens would just pop right out but during my first rudimentary repair I didn't look at the screen much because I was so flustered with the rest of the mess hidden behind the screws.

Rip, I have a black case which I'd have to imagine they won't be producing replacement parts for... I'd be fine with just getting the part and having to uv glue it into the top cover or something...

It makes me really disappointed every time I see the scratch... I didn't get the screen protector on soon enough :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
The screens are some kind of ultrasonic weld or rather sturdy glue.... I'd imagine it'll be hard to replace without the whole case but I'd like to be wrong. 

What I'd really like to see is a proper made case. Currently the cheese-grade screws with rather coarse threads just thread into the plastic screw posts in the case. Ideally these screwed would be switched out for proper machine screws and would thread into a brass threaded insert. 

One can dream.

Hey there. Heres some suggestions. MOST keys for such things as garage doors use a frequency of 315 or 433.92. I would confirm which frequency its outputting by using the frequency analyzer under Sub-ghz. Then configure the raw recorder accordingly. Id suggest trying AM270 if youre not already. Seemed to work the best for me. Range isnt fantastic so make sure your kinda close to the garage door. Hope this helps!

yes I tried it, it doesn't work, as the CAME gate doesn't use shift register, and there should be some padding before the gate and some gaps after it.   de Bruijn sequence only works for plan 0's and 1's which is extremely rare these days to find something that old
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
I already scratched my screen, I want them to sell replacement screens pls!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
Have you tried if a de Bruijn sequence works for the CAME protocol? By overlapping multiple codes it's significantly faster in trying all the combinations. For 12 bits it should only take ~15 seconds. [Here are a bunch of pregenerated files](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Sub-GHz/Garages/deBruijn) if you'd like to try. Files with db12 in the name should be suitable for 12 bits.

Looking at your files, [this one](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Sub-GHz/Garages/deBruijn/EU_Edition/Raw/Db12-433MHz-EU.sub) is probably the most suitable one.

Also, NFC wiki is still empty. 2 years after :/

p.s. I scanned some NFC cards, but I can't open doors with it. 

It was Milfare DESFire cards. What am I doing wrong?

Flipper can emulate only UID? What about data that was read from card?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02

Yes I have already thought about all such ideas, and consider them impractical.

Considering that most of the time I come to the broken machines not machines to me:
Powered USB hub? Then I'll have to bring the hub and some power supply. And I'll need a spare outlet. Oh, we're on the road? No outlet then! Perhaps a power bank it is then? Is it charged though? Does the hub have detachable cable? One more cable it is.

Don't get me started on increasing the points of failure. Nothing's more annoying than troubleshooting why the IODD isn't reliability being recognized (for example) only for it to turn out there's faulty port on the USB hub.

Or why is my USB speed falling to 2.0 levels?

All-in-all the best 3 solutions IMO are:

Use some other less advanced USB device to boot bootstrapper - be it even just an old 2GB USB2 flash drive.

Use phone to boot into bootstrapper, by utilizing drivedroid, for example.

Can't use bootstrapper? Instead of full-blown USB 3.x powered hub and power supply, bring just an USB 3 Y-shaped cable (3.x M + 2. M to 3.x F) and some "USB power outputting device" (phone charger, power bank, USB OTG / USB PD capable phone etc...)

You'll need disassemble your device, follow this guide:

I also have the same key fob and it doesn't work for me either.

Here's my experience, in case it's useful to anybody:

- I tried to read the radio signal with my Flipper just out of the box (original, outdated firmware):
-- with modulation set to AM: nothing detected
-- with modulation set to FM: Flipper consistently detected an encrypted radio signal, protocol "unknown", different ID every time.

- now I run the Unleashed Code Grabber firmware:
-- with modulation set to AM: still nothing
-- with modulation set to FM: inconsistent behavior:
--- 50% chance it detects nothing,
--- 45% chance it's an encrypted signal labeled "unknown",
--- 5% chance it detects an encrypted signal named something like "NICE_smilo" or "Leopard"
- Code Grabber firmware allows these encrypted signals to be saved and reproduced, but expectedly they won't work.

Also tried, of course, to record raw signal (both with AM and FM modulation), but nothing to do... :(

These key fobs are so fragile and easy to break... I'd love if it was possible to replace them with my Flipper!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
I'm referring to hosts which do not have anything installed, such as badusb
targets. The code snippet is currently used by me as part of a badusb script
to exfil data from the host, writing it to Flipper's storage. It kind of
works, but if I had mass storage it'd be much easier and probably more
reliable. Even if it's slow, it'd be a massive improvement.

1 : 2022-08-02
I suppose the only practical use would be to boot things like rEFInd boot manager. It'd be slow, and you'd need other media to boot the next iso / boot entry from, but it's lifesaver for older hardware that can't boot some sw directly, properly. Or some motherboards are power cycling USB ports on boot. A bit rare but annoying AF since I have 0 chances of booting from my pin protected IODD. So this 2-step process through use of boot managers can be the only way in such cases.

#what in the world 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-02
I don't know, as there's no possibility to upload anything to a Flipper
without a bunch of SDKs, I'm piping data through the serial console, which is
so hacky that I crash Flipper any now and then. What I do is weird even by my
standards:

    stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 115200 raw -echo
    exec 3&lt;/dev/ttyACM0
    cat &lt;&amp;3 &gt; /dev/null
    PID=$!  echo -e "storage write /ext/exfil.dat\r" &gt; /dev/ttyACM0
    sleep 2
    echo -e "never gonna give you up\r" &gt; /dev/ttyACM0
    sleep 2
    echo $'\cc' &gt; /dev/ttyACM0
    sleep 2
    kill $PID
    wait $PID 2&gt;/dev/null
    exec 3&lt;&amp;-

So, yes, a USB mass storage feature even when slow is a massive improvement.

I try it i record it in my house and then go to the gt but nothing.
I will try again tonight.

Thanks for that! This would have been handy before dismantling it on my own :). I broke one of the two little tabs that hold the two sides together. However, with the screws it holds well now. 
When putting it together I also broke one of the pins for the ibutton but I think this is an easy fix with the soldering iron and I don't need the ibutton anyways.

He lives!! I'm so happy  I gave him another session with the hairdryer and let him rest the night with the back removed for extra airflow and he turned on again! So for all the people having the same issue: Give it a couple of days and he probably will come back if it's fresh water. 

I will close the gpio ports and the SD slot with tape to keep moisture and dust out. I maybe even order one of these USB port rubber plugs. 

Thanks for all the comments!

This is still a bit of a work in progress, but the STL files are here: [https://github.com/HaxHeadroom/HaxHeadroom-FlipperZero-Goodies/tree/main/Hardware/Bezel\_Delete\_casemod](https://github.com/HaxHeadroom/HaxHeadroom-FlipperZero-Goodies/tree/main/Hardware/Bezel_Delete_casemod)

The idea is:

* 3D print the insert
* Open the old flipperoo up and place against window

What you see is:

* V2 of the print (from the repo above)
* Places on top of window  just to test things out.

I am still fine tuning the print itself.  It is based off the official 3D models:

Bruh what you opening 12 garage doors for? Lol

Make sure your on AM270. Seemed to work the best for me. Make sure your relatively close to the garage door. Also be sure that the fobs are emitting 433.92. Go to the frequency analyzer and see what comes up.
-------------------------------

It could be using an unknown rolling protocol.
Try to record the signal far away from the receiver, and then emulate it in the surroundings.

So PWNAGOTCHI support in a few weeks then?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
If you keep using your normal remote, after enough times the garage opener would stop responding to the flipper since it will be out of range of the next expected rolling code value. So you would need to alternate if you want both of them to control the garage opener.

I didn't care to use my original remotes anymore so I just use the flipper for my garage openers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Thanks for the explanation! It sounds like its not a big deal to get working if youre mostly using the Flipper as a backup remote. Is that fair to say?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
awesome thank you so much! ill pm you with updates!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
I don't blame you, it's a cool little device. I ordered one and forgot to get the wifi board. If you find your DS screen protector and want to use it, cut it in a way that you can still use the rest in case the 1st one goes wrong. I got it right on the 1st try and you can't even tell the flipper has a screen protector on, no bubbles and the sides are flat and blend in nicely
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
I actually haven't had much luck pairing my flipper as a new remote on my garage door opener. I am currently running the Unleashed FW and it allows you to capture your existing remote's signal if it is Security+ 1.0 or 2.0 (which is what liftmaster universal remotes use).

Security+ 1.0 and 2.0 are rolling code protocols, but are not allowed to be "learned" on the Official FW. So, you would need to use one of the custom FWs out there that allow it.

Just a word of caution, this can cause your actual garage door remote to stop working if you use the flipper enough times.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
That's why I made this post. I was expecting to find it in that database but it wasn't included. I'll see what's been added more recently. I cross referenced the Sharp with all the others on that list and none were listed as comparable. I'll start testing what's in the list and maybe I'll find a matchup. Hopefully this post will attract someone who has the Sharp codes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
thanks for getting back to me! i just got trigger happy when i ordered my unit and i for got to get the case and the screen protectors werent out when i ordered. i think i might have cheap plastic screen protectors for a ds somewhere. im still considering getting a case i just dont know when.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Sorry, I missed your comment. But quality of the case is pretty great. After dyeing quality is still the same. For an orange strap I'd say Amazon or eBay you will find many options to choose from. Currently Flipper has screen protectors on their site you can order, or if you want to go DIY, buy a cheap plastic screen protector for any device like a phone and cut it to size for the Flipper. I did this with and extra Nintendo 3ds screen protector I had, I cut it to size with a sharp pair of scissors for a clean cut and it looks great and does the job

I got it as a penetration testing learning tool. I am a noob with very limited knowledge on the subject and I have found tons of easy uses for the flipper! I have loved learning all about the different functions it has. I am sure you could get something similar or build something yourself, but the flipper is just an easy choice. All of the basic functions of penetration testing is there, and if you start learning about it and find out the flipper does not have the functionality you need, its pretty easy to find peripherals that compliment the flipper. I love the tomagatchi like aesethic to it and its super cute to see what my little buddy is up to whenever I grab my flipper. The community is starting to pick up and noob friendly content is starting to surface.  I would say its like 6+ months untill it has everything you need, but honestly its so easy and fun to learn, you'll have a great time with it. I have had a ton of fun learning the badusb functionality. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honestly its totally worth it for me just for the ability to open up the tesla charge ports while I am at work. It brings me joy, and for that, I think its worth it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Wow that's cool to know, Embed hardware with DB firmware. I'll have to ask my buddy how they are different as he's worked with generic Embed swipers at a different arcade compared to where he now works, which is DB.


I'm assuming I've worked with the Embed firmware ones. I liked them, very easy to put in test mode and test out the credit line using card with a magnetic strip. They also boot up fast compared to Intercard swipers. Those take like 10min :o

For your garages, did you press the learn button on the motors or get the signal from the receivers? Ive tried to read as much as I can about this, but cant seem to find out how well it works. I know rolling codes are discussed as an issue, but I wasnt sure if pairing the Flipper from the learn button makes this more likely to work.

Personally its definitely a nice gadget and if you like tech stuff like this Id definitely say go for it. Even if you dont have that much programming experience this might even help push you forward on it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Please do not use or spread the rice/silica method. It does not work any better than not using them.

Lots of airflow and time is what helps. I can't help but see everyone using it and claiming it works when in reality they just make the drying process slower and harder. The absolute best method for drying is constant (preferably warm, but not too warm) airflow, just like how tumble dryers work with our clothes. There's a reason why you don't fill those up with rice, and yet they still dry stuff.

No, rice and silica gel won't technically harm your device. But it might make a mess if you spill it. And you wasted perfectly good rice too. And not to mention, it blocks the much more helpful airflow from reaching the device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Yep, not workable with the Flipper. But if you're interested in radio messaging, this is definitely the project you're looking for. Good luck!

It really depends on your definition of "worth it." I use mine daily as a tv and garage remote for multiple tvs and garages. I have also stored some key fobs and rfid cards to get through doors. So it really is a useful little tech multitool for me.

I also enjoy playing around with new features as people dev them on github. Additionally, it has helped fuel my learning around IR codes and Subghz transmissions.

If you want the most out of the flipper I would strongly encourage visiting the Awesome Flipper github and being part of the Discord channels.

Best of luck. You might also want to ask about alcohol. IPA (iso-propanol) is very good at cleaning and very good at getting rid of moisture. The stuff itself evaporates much quicker than water. I've used in the past to recuse keyboards and such. However, hopefully someone from the company can say whether it is good in this case.

That was fascinating! I just lost an hour reading about LoRa. I don't think the Flipper is capable of LoRa though so you'd have to use a GPIO expansion board to use meshtastic. Very cool though. Now I'm eyeing those Lilygo LoRa modules.

I think it's a good piece of hardware, but I haven't been able to find a single use case for it. So it seems to be good for whatever it was designed, but I might not be the target audience because to me it's not very useful.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
I would have to ask again, I know the newer DLC lets you design places for some of the animal/villagers and the roguemaster/unleashed firmware includes a library of every animal crossing amiibo. I believe you can add furniture or decorations through some of the amiibos, also if you need a specific villager there is a place in game where you can essentially summon them with NFC and have tea or whatever with them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Nice the above links may work for a semi permanent mod which I may do at some point, I was thinking to test I might get one of those cheap phone camera snap on mid to Tele lenses and use in reverse.

Really good idea. Maybe it would have prevented this. If he comes back to life or I order a new one I will definitely tape the ports.

As it is a device that is going to be all day hanging around in backpacks/pockets and there are already cases of dust inside the screen because it is not sealed; what I have done since I do not use the gpio ports is to cover them with electrician's tape, as well as the sd slot. In the usb port I have put a universal rubber plug. It will help a little, but it would be nice if it came sealed from the factory or if we had the option of a more closed case to cover the ports.

It's a learning tool, if you already have different hardware that interfaces with the wireless tech that it does then probably not worth it. If you don't and you want to delve further into the tech and learn more, experiment, develop some stuff (and you have the $$), I'd say it's absolutely worth it and can be a good deal of fun.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
This device is an amazing learning tool. If that is what you qualify as 'worth' then 100% yes.

On the other hand, there is a learning curve to all the technologies this thing has to offer, some of them not being exactly ready to use out of the box. So if not looking forward to getting your hands a little dirty i'd say hold off.

For me that's the fun of it, is messing around with how things work. but there are cool simple party tricks you can get your hands on and easily grow your knowledge from there!

Unsurprising given the ports for the extension board.. 

If you must use it in the rain, wrap it even if it just in a pocket that can get wet.

People have mentioned rice which helps but better keep it somewhere warm and dry for a a few days. Even better if you can open case to disconnect the battery and make it easier for air to get to the board and components. There is a YouTube video to help you do that

Marketing was a bit over ambitious and drew in a lot of people thinking this was going to be a point and shoot hacking device which would deliver on all the PR claims out of the box (not seeing all the 'coming soon' / 'in development' notes) 

If you have very little programming experience (probably even if you do) , you will most likely not be having any 'I can't believe I'm doing this!' moments. This is more of a  'that's nice' moments device 

Look at the posts and check how many real use cases appeal to you.

1 : 2022-08-01
Just look at the hardware, like the actual components. Ask yourself, what do you want to do with it? What do you want to do with the IR? The LF RFID? and so on. Do you know how the protocols work?

If you have a hard time figuring out what you would even do with it you have a few choices. You can say I'm going to explore the hardware and protocols more and learn about how they work and find things to use it with. You can say, mmm I don't really know what to do with it so I'll just wait and see what other people do to get ideas. Or you can say, mmm I don't really know what to do with it and I probably don't have the time to be exploring how the stuff works and won't use it much if at all if I don't have specific instructions. 

Try framing yourself within those choices and it should give you an idea of what you want.

* [read more here](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/settings) but here is a quick guide.

`Default   corresponds to Info
None  logging is turned off
Error  only errors are logged
Warning  errors and warnings are logged
Info  errors, warnings, and info messages are logged
Debug  adds debug messages
Trace  adds tracing information from various subsystems, which in some cases may slow down your device`

But here is the answer to your question:

* On the old Flipperaroo go to `settings --&gt; system` set the logging level
* On your computer connect to the CLI (instructions below) and type `log`


 FlipperCLI is just re-branded with my art. Its already on device.

To connect just do:

* To find your device: `ls /dev/cu.*`

* Find your Flipper (includes its name): `/dev/cu.usbmodemflip_[YOURDEVICE]`

* Connect with: `screen /dev/cu.usbmodemflip_[YOURDEVICE] 9600` (or use Putty)

* RTFFM with: help
`&gt;: help
Commands we have:
! ir
? led
bt loader
crypto log
date music_player
debug nfc
device_info onewire
factory_reset power
free ps
free_blocks rfid
gpio start_rpc_session
help storage
i2c subghz
ikey update
input vibro`

People are always free to share a file anywhere, including through emails. And if you receive such an email, you can open the file in the Flipper App in a couple taps, since we have these file extensions bound to it.

This is  why tap to pay is more secure than swiping. It basically encrypts each transaction.

LOOOOOVE the idea about Morse code.  Brilliant.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Oh, awesome! May i share some ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

* Use all available interfaces
   * UC Wire: flippers can be connected using simple wire (coil from Ethernet or other) and transmissions messages in old-faction Electrical telegraph style
   * UC IR: The same as wire but via IR 
* Security
   * Get PGP from the server e.g [https://keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) via mobile app 
   * Offline exchange via NFC (two flippers should be placed nearby for "pairing" aka keys change)
   * Private groups (or DM) can work basically encrypting messages with all necessary public PGP keys
* Mobile-app assist (aka second mesh)
   * App can also act as mesh node for messages (iOS MultiPeer framework) in this case we will have two mesh networks (flipper based and app based) this will allow to have more resilience, example - [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/berkanan-messenger/id1289061820](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/berkanan-messenger/id1289061820) [https://github.com/zssz/BerkananSDK](https://github.com/zssz/BerkananSDK)
-------------------------------

So I was searching and the IR wavelength is around 870-950 nm. This means that with any proper lens you could do this. You can take a look at some optical providers, like Thorlabs ([https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup\_id=13685](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=13685)) Edmund ([https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/vis-nir-coated-plano-convex-pcx-lenses/12278/](https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/vis-nir-coated-plano-convex-pcx-lenses/12278/)), etc. I point toward the cheap lens that will present aberration, you can get something more fancy but you don't need to. I would advice you to get one with short focal length and place it at the focal length of the emitting diode.

For the other one, I don't know and I am also quite interested

It will be better than the Zero, but you'll have to wait at least a year (probably two) instead of one month

Ya if it keeps failing just go to the website and download it directly. 

Then connect your flipper and update if you choose to do so.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-08-01
Because it is. That's all the data on the NFC section of the card, and that's only so the merchant can make a record of who paid, because they cannot see *anything* that happens during the actual transaction. It's all a back and forth between the EMV chip and the payment network. In fact, this partly how 'Privacy numbers' came about, where the merchant would get a semi-random - but legit - number instead of the actual card number.
-------------------------------

If no one did, I guess it's time to write about it in the bugs on GitHub

TL;DR, the flipper is what you make it. 

Your value of the product is dependent on your expectations. 

If youre expecting to just be able to access, open, or decrypt anything any where upon receiving the tool, you will be disappointed. 

If you have a desire to learn about how things in this realm work, IE; pentest, Wi-Fi hacking, different NFC types, utilizing the gpio ports for running custom scripts on a devboard, etc. then, the flipper will be an astonishingly useful tool, untouched by anything currently offered on the market. 

The community itself is what contributes to the flippers value. 

The capabilities of the flipper today are not what the capabilities will be tomorrow. Its capabilities will only expand with time as more people contribute to the collective databases that support the device.

&gt;Makes it kind of pointless to have RFID in the passport tbh except as an extra layer of counterfeit prevention, since the encrypted RFID data is just the same info that's printed on the page that has the decryption key on it.

Makes total sense as the information in the information cannot (easily) be read without physical access to the passport. Many passports with NFC chips are [biometric passports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport) that contain e.g. fingerprints, mine does.

It can't read all the data. What it can read is just the same information that is printed on the front of the card, but the internal keys and applications that are actually used for a transaction are still secure.

Believe me, you do *not* want it any other way.

Nope, it's impossible to get it working.

Nope, that's impossible. The whole point of EMV is that it involves strong cryptography, and it's nearly impossible to just clone a card and use it normally.

We might start storing large keys on the backend because trying to share them via hash parameters would make a veeery long link. But if/when we start doing this, all the files you share will be encrypted locally, and only the person who has access to the link will have access to the file. We would only have access to a bunch of encrypted bytes because the encryption key will also be a hash, a client-side parameter. Encrypted uploads on mega-dot-nz work the same way.  
P.S. Nothing from this comment is implemented yet in Flipper apps.

1 : 2022-07-31
Hey, this is wrong. As a person, who is fighting for privacy at Flipper, I would like to explain. Nothing is stored on the backend, and we don't get access to your keys when you share them through flpr.app links.  
Look at the example link: https://dev.flpr.app/s#path=infrared/Philips\_sndbar.ir&amp;Filetype=IR+signals+file&amp;Version=1&amp;name=Power&amp;type=parsed&amp;protocol=RC6&amp;address=10+00+00+00&amp;command=0C+00+00+00&amp;name=Vol\_up&amp;type=parsed&amp;protocol=RC6&amp;address=10+00+00+00&amp;command=10+00+00+00&amp;name=Vol\_dn&amp;type=parsed&amp;protocol=RC6&amp;address=10+00+00+00&amp;command=11+00+00+00  
All the sensitive information goes after the "#", hash symbol. Hash means client-side parameters, they are not transferred to the server. Only your browser has access to these parameters and uses them to launch your Flipper Mobile App to save the key.

not all cars use rolling codes.  
can't say for or against this case in particular but your statement that "Car remotes change If on every single button press" is not correct for all cars.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-31
Huh, I have the unlocked firmware and used it on my visa card. When I went to do tap to pay, it just didn't read the flipper. I wonder if it depends on the terminal.

Yeah, this is the problem I ran into. I would try to use contactless pay, and the reader would say, "Present only one card" or something like that. Anybody have tips to get it working?

I used it in the same manner and it worked..

Possibly fake! Could be pressing a remote button with his other hand. Car remotes change If on every single button press to prevent the clone of the signal. So very likely a fake videl

Folders are the best solution I have found. I have a base folder for type of device (TV, HVAC, etc.) Then inside if there are too many files to be manageable, I break them Into alphabetical chunks (a-f,g-m). If you have an extra large library that is still unmanageable with single letter folders, just repeat with the 2nd letter.

Not a valid card 1 .. 2 Im not connected to Bluetooth.. kinda trolling here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-31
I was wondering about what kind of exfiltration might occur with Bluetooth pairing of the flipper to a phone.

Appreciate you for this insight!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-31
Would be more scared to scan my Bank Card and bluetooth pair it with the Smart Phone App. Keys you pair to your phone seems to also be stored on [dev.flpr.app](https://dev.flpr.app). This becomes apparent when trying to share your keys.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-31
How can I not, when it clearly has GPIO outs to hook it up to Tens pads for r/estim
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-31
An example would be: if I go to Infrared app -&gt; saved remotes, I would find an option where I can search for a saved remote's name (using the flipper keyboard) instead of scrolling down through my long list of saved remotes to find what I'm looking for.

This would be useful since there are libraries of IR (for example) for flipperzero that has so many remote names/brands and it would be more practical to be able to reach the file you are trying to emulate quickly in a real life scenario

It's highly unlikely that the fob was triggering the lights.  It's most likely that the flashing of the car lights was tripping a light sensor.

Yes indeed, I'm using Rogue Master 0.63.2-0728-RM-T. In a gist, I'm creating
files containing monotone sound signals created by
[ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave). However, by default ggwave
writes 16-bit WAV files, and playing these is neither supported (it's
mentioned in the code) and results in pretty garbled output. But I get
output.

After converting the very same file to 8 bits, the file doesn't play at all.
OK, but your input was already valuable. First, there are already newer
FW-version available, RM seems to churn out new releases every other day,
*and* I'm on vacation, *and* I have way too much free time so I'll just play
around until I know what I'm doing wrong :-)

Thanks!

On GitHub somebody else seems to have that problem. Maybe someone with that problem has access to a Proxmark3. In that case you can dump both the card and the flipper emulating it to compare where the difference is.

I think the only exception to this rule is if you have a really cool or unique name (I saw one that's name was lowk3y, which is pretty cool) but otherwise, I don't really care that you received your device that a majority of us have on this subreddit. That should be a new rule on the subreddit.

&gt;Nope, we have a separate field for the serial number

I stand corrected.  Thank you for that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Basically there's two reasons  
The first is that yes, we've made it mostly for sentimental value, but the second one is that the internal flash can be easily cleared when debugging or flashing via DFU while not using qFlipper, and we didn't want you to accidentally delete your Flipper's name, so it's permanently written into the OTP
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Nope, we have a separate field for the serial number

I tried multiple rates, sample widths, etc... and it kinda played whatever I threw at it.  I am also using my own firmware with the old ELF loader.  So I am curious what version you are using (is it the fap?)

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Why would the flipper use OTP memory for the name? Is it just to permanently attach sentimental value to it? is it cheaper to use OTP memory?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Try turning it off and turn it on again?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
That'll probably fail :(

We've tried doing that, and the resulting cases come out VERY brittle and break from the slightest pressure, so silicone-molding is probably not feasible
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Yeah, its just a dumb trick.  I kinda have an alternative motive for doing it this way.   If you are at Def Con hmu to find out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
No, the name is stored in the OTP (one-time programmable) memory which is read-only.

However, you can edit the firmware to read the name from somewhere else.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Yes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Of anyone makes one I WILL buy it no matter what, that would be so cool

1 : 2022-07-30
Ahahaha oh okay I get it now. 

I thought this was looking at an RF bandscope scan and this was broadcast from the flipper via the subGHz radio and being viewed on a PC radio receiver. 

I didn't realize it was all just audio!

Thnx
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Thanks!  I didn't really do anything that requires anything more than a laptop.  I wanted to find the quickest and most approachable way to do this so I could just build the files and play them via the flipper

I wrote it up here - complete with animations and errrthang.  (its not a firmware link mods); [https://github.com/HaxHeadroom/HaxHeadroom-FlipperZero-Goodies/tree/main/tools/CatchTheWav](https://github.com/HaxHeadroom/HaxHeadroom-FlipperZero-Goodies/tree/main/tools/CatchTheWav)

Essentially I am taking an existing python library to create the wav file and then playing it through the flipper.

The MacOS app im using supports real time analysis through the built in mic.   [https://friture.org/](https://friture.org/)

So its `img2wav --&gt; Copy to flipper --&gt; play through flipper --&gt; Visualize with laptop`
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
If you can figure out the frequency the fob was broadcasting on, and where these lights are, sure you can.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Weren't you running qFlipper with some compatibility options set, by any chance?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
It will be nice to see measurements by proper equipment.
In general we do not implement PD on our side, instead we use passive indication that we are legacy device.

That scheme allows us to assume that we can draw up to 1A.
But current consumption will depend on battery charge state and ability of power source to provide that current (charger will automatically adjust current if source voltage is dropping)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Works for timezone and kingpin in Melbourne. Just uses the cards unique identifier rather than data stored on the card. It would be possible to change to another card but picking one at random would be hard to find one with tickets or credits.

Sure, the brand reads "VIGIK" on the NFC reader, seems to be a french company
-------------------------------

Yes, you can clone and emulate mifare classic cards with the flipper

Can you attach a video of you emulating the card to a reader? You need to hold the flipper still for a few seconds for the emulation to work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Hm, that should work

Are you mabe emulating just the UID of the tag?

There is a nice semi hard case from dollar tree.  Comes in red, blue, black.

O ok, I like this PL cuz I found something on github called marioheadBSOD where it pops up a mario head video of him saying it's a me mario! then causes a BSOD. I just need to get around to building it and writing a ducky to launch it. The BSOD method is probably old as well, there's a kernel debug function that calls a BSOD instead of some hacky shit that I might have to change the method to as well. So I like seeing how this is a more basic form of that and it's awesome to see.

Great name!

1 : 2022-07-30
Also maybe try modify jakobys one liner rickroll and add the max volume code and instead deliver your mario head video then shutdown. Using web browsers to launch your video with the different types of web browsers and video services there's too much variation. So locally downloading the video and playing it is more effective. So think of alt more effective ways of delivering payloads.
-------------------------------

I tried doing powershell Start-Process chrome -ArgumentList "-k [https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1](https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1), but it only worked when i opened powershell and typed it in
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Ah, okay, thanks! If I emulate the tag my iPhone won't read it though... Doesn't that work?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Maybe add some more delay in your launch processes, if it's too short it will skip past the launch window on older machines trying to process the commands and if you miss the launch process your PL doesn't get launched. Also I don't feel like starting up a win VM to see if you can optimize your script with putting the "Start-Process chrome -ArgumentList "-k [https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1](https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1)" string into the second launching of PS so it's "powershell Start-Process chrome -ArgumentList "-k [https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1](https://vimeo.com/734095493?autoplay=1)"" and save a few seconds on the PL. Spin up a win VM and start testing your payloads manually. Manually doing the actions written out and copy/pasting the commands you can test if it will work outside of the delay functionality. Doing that can also help you write PL's by going through the functions and writing down step by step what you did to go where. Mostly useful for writing mobile stuff that's very shortcut orientated. But there's also plenty of win based gui stuff you can play with that way as well.

You're better off installing an app to your phone called "NFC tools" and edit the NDEF payload through it, at the moment

You can also install the flipper ios app on the mac from the AppStore just without keyboard controll

Thank you a lot for the answer. My Flipper has found all the sector keys, so I believe the issue is about the clock cycle. Do you think this will be fixed someday?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Well, close to 100% of my wireless cards/badges are NFC Mifare cards... If this cannot be fixed, my Flipper will become literally useless
-------------------------------

I also have not been successful in emulating any Mifare cards. I believe this is a known issue.

I wasnt able to place an order to the US about a week ago and was told the US sold out and would restock in September, then a few days ago I tried again and it worked. Any idea when these new US ones will ship?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Yep. The BT range is not great (with any device), but at least people don't come to ask what is that thing.

1 : 2022-07-30
Mine is Eovww ... I cant even say that..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Ill type it slower so you can understand.

By introducing your flipper, you associate your Reddit account with your flipper AND your name.  Who did they ship to again?  Thats a pretty fair assumption.

Now you could have replied, the flipper folks wont out my name/Reddit account!  Now thats the big assumption.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30

I don't know what else I can show. https://imgur.com/r1T7Tzu.jpg
-------------------------------

You need to provide additional info about the type of card you are trying to emulate as there may not be support for it

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Could you please provide the compiled version as well?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Woah. Too cool. So you place the flipper somewhere and then control it from your laptop?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Thats fantastic. I would like to get this merged in to the active IRDB, within its own folder kind of like I have the Pronto and CSV conversions now. That way it can be known there might be things that dont work and might be duplicates but people can find that out for themselves.

Something else we have thought about doing is sorting them into categories by number and letter so its a bit easier to browse through on the Flipper screen. I saw an issue was opened up with the same request on this one.

Would you rather do a PR against the original or should I just merge it into place? Thank you for bringing attention to this.

Yes, that is what the Flipper shows. But the USB power spy shows 600 mA more. Where is that consumed? That is basically my question.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Correct.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Hi, yes, it works. Took me a couple tries to figure out how to use it but now I can unlock in first attempt pretty much.

You need to slightly push the flipper to the bottom of the pad to get a good contact of the ground pin to the inner circumference.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
I scratched my flipper in 3 places making a protector myself :/

At least the screen is fine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
I think OPs question is regarding the discrepancy between the USB tester figures and those reported by the flipper itself, i.e. where did those 600mA go?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
On both pictures you included, the charging current is up to 1A which is at spec. Not more, just a tiny bit less. Overall right in at spec.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
What's the question?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
If its a classic theres a good chance it can be emulated with the flipper. But just emulating the UID (like you did in the photo) isnt enough.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Btw. Does yours work with ibuttons? I van read but emulate fails on the ones in Estonia that I have tried
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-30
Afaik all places are pretty much sold out right now. One of my friends ordered from the official Flipper shop and hit a notice there it will be shipped in August.

https://lab401.com had still stock last week, but sold out, too. They are the official distributor in Europe.
If you want one quickly, check your local used things websites. Many are sold right now, some even cheaper than the official websites.

Is it possible to program the flipper as a remote for a rolling code remote (NICE FLO1R)? The receiver supports enrolling a new remote with the help of an authorized remote.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
You're not going to find a download that just opens all gates. 
As astra as said they use different codes and frequencies. Some static, some rolling. 

Brute forcing 26bit and 36but codes is also a bit of a tall order. Simple due to the sheer number of combinations.

Your best bet is to research the target gate. Determine its frequency and if it's rolling code then go from there.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
Each gate has its own signal, there's no universal ones
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
I'd rather they banned posts where people are bragging about doing illegal things with their Flippers before the completely benign introductions.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
Totally agree with this. not because I'm not happy for everyone, but because it clutters useful posts about the actual product. Seeing yet another gadget is......well boring. Seeing what you've done with it is cool.

On that note, we should also have a mega thread for beginner ideas on what to do with it. Since half this thread purchased it because it looked cool, not because of the features.

So we should make 2 threads: 

Flipper Lounge (posting our new flippers, and how long we've been waiting for them)

Flipper for Dummies (ideas for people who don't know what to do with them, and why they bought it)

And the rest of the threads should be more about the product like "new firmware allows you to hack all the government bathrooms due to a log4toilet vulnerability which allows you to sniff data through SubGHz"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
How you did that?

If I understand it correctly, the support for various standards (of tags, NFC cards, everything) has to be built in the firmware, so it actually knows how to read them and the support is not there yet for your tags.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
I updated the firmware before trying. 
Most of the ones that doesn't work, will work as NFC. Maybe there's something I don't understand?

I'd say those tags are 13.56MHz ones that don't work yet. 125 kHz ones work allright for me, one FDI Urmet does not. It always helps if you posted what kind of tags they were. Also, have you updated the firmware?

This is one of my biggest bugbears in this and other subs. People posting screenshots of order confirmations, then shipping notifications, then a picture of the box, then the unboxed item. Most of us are on these subs because we have the item in question, there's no benefit in seeing other people's orders/shipping/boxes/items.

It's like this on every gadget subreddit. Endless streams of posts about cases, button mods, themes, and skins... Just to get a dose of that sweet dopamine from meaningless points on the internet. Hell, sometimes people just shitpost pictures of the device, like this one. 

I wholeheartedly agree.

For Sub1Ghz files with .sub as ending: Open them up with a text editor and check which frequency is contained. You can change that in the file and save as .sub in case it is not the frequency of your region.
For Tesla many files have 315 MHz (US), but when you are in Europe you need to change that to 433.92 MHz.

NFC-V is a type that stores 8 bytes while other NFC types usually only have a capacity of 7 bytes. As of now, Flipper only supports 7 byte versions, but Ive read somewhere on their Discord that NFC-V support is planned but other features have higher priority.

ISO 15693, also known as NFC-V is a type of NFC card that is made to be read as far as possible (more than 10cm with compatible readers)

Flipper doesn't yet have software support for those cards, but will in the future

I'm no expert, but wouldn't u need like a singnal to get sent were the flipper can figure out the frequency and stuff then record it. From there you can modify it for colours and stuff. I don't really know just what I thought
-------------------------------

Yes, I gave you an answer in your other posting.

I'm confused,.is Marauder an app u added to you flipper that lets it beacon WiFi networks?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
you can use filement in the holes on the back for the hinge. just superglue it on the bottom part.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
Yes, it does, I just tried it. My BIOS expects the escape key, that worked. However, it takes some time for the flipper to detect that the system is accepting keyboards now and depending on how long the PC waits for the BIOS keystroke it might be too late. Was a close call, I only have a tiny window of opportunity, perhaps a second or so.

Maybe this is more of a Github question, I'm quite new to this device. **How do I add .c application files to the Flipper Zero?**

For example, I want to install "Flappy Bird" from the below location. It's already coded, but how do I compile and add it to my device?

What do you mean? Our USB chip literally does not support being a USB host at the hardware level. You're probably confusing this with mounting the flipper as a mass storage device, where it acts as a USB peripheral, not a host.

Because the key is not transmitted, only data encrypted with it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-29
If anyone other also struggles, I managed to solve this by completely reflashing the firmware through recovery mode. 

This issue arose cuz I didn't originally have an sd card in my unit when updating the firmware, and subsequent updates did not update the DB files as well.
-------------------------------

&gt;one does no longer have to compile it into the firmware.

If you are transmitting, anyone in reach can triangulate you with the right equipment.
And if they find you transmitting illegally (like on the wrong frequencies or stronger than allowed), youll have a problem 

To the question of whos going to check that - that depends on the region youre in. In a lot of countries the military or intelligence services are monitoring radio frequency either with fixed installations or equipped cars/vans. In other countries the companies/agency in charge of flights/air traffic are doing that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-28
well that depends highly on the standard used. Ive never seen LF systems myself and on HF only Mifare Classic really works (unless you have a really shitty system that checks only the uid, then a few other standards might work on the flipper)
-------------------------------

So I did just that tonight. At a local Italian restaurant that uses the pagers, we were sat next to the hostess stand, I raw captured them paging and then saved it. A few minutes later they gave the same pager back out (they just grabbed the same one and handed it back out) I retransmitted the capture and it went off. They came back in and the lady said oh Im sorry I dont know why that happened I saved it as Pager 52

Which githubn plugin tutorial did you read? The one I constanttly found was outdated, referring to files that did no longer exist and were instead automatically generated by the build scripts.

This one here  is IMHO the best: https://flipper.atmanos.com/docs/category/your-first-plugin

However, as far as I know (I can't find the statement anymore) there are currently no API docs and there won't be any until firmware v1.0 is realesed. The whole plugin system will be overhaled as well, so that one does no longer have to compile it into the firmware.

Sorry, video could have been clearer.  Rather than using Ducky Script to click through the UAC, I wrote a bypass in PowerShell that then calls an AMSI bypass that then finally runs Mimikatz as admin and exfils the results to a remote server (encrypted of course).  The Target box is a completely patched Windows 10 box (built this morning) with Windows Defender and all of the bells and whistles turned on.   Not sure if this fits here, but I executed it on my Flipper Zero so...

Traffic lights operate on 900mhz (and ghz), so in theroy, if you could capture it raw off of an ambulance or firetruck and your city uses it. Then you could probably change lights green but the penalties for this would likely be costly and includ jail time.

Thank you, I assume this is what you let run on your machine with the flipper being connected. As far as I can see it doesn't support the sub-GHz radio, which I'd also like to play around. I was looking for something that would enable me to develop plugins or "apps" for the little guy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-28
I feel some assumptions are being made in your code. Magnitude is never transmitted as far as I'm aware, and a single value would not make sense given there are 3 sensors in a fully populated wand.

The ID is transmitted, alongside a cast type, flick, twirl, or hover (hover is only sent when a IR receiver inside the wand is triggered, some wands lack this). 

These cast types ultimately go unused, but the cast log still records them. As far as Ive always been aware this cast type is decided by the wand itself, not based on magnitude data, but I could look more into this later.

Officially, a wand id is recognized "00FFFFFF" as an example. The beginning denotes a wand type with 0 being basic, 3 being dragon, etc. The wand types have gotten a bit messy in the GWL era wands however between dragons being produced without this, clubhouse crew plushies using wand tech, etc.

Brute force makes literally zero sense. You have to hope that:
A. You generate a wand id that is actually used.
B. The owner of the ID just happens to be at the lodge that day.
C. The owner has time on their account at that lodge.

I just miss the days when a wand was $8, the takeover has done great things for MagiQuest (and by great I mean god awful).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-28
MagiQuest is just a glorified TV remote at the end of the day, the code is just longer. There's a wand ID, and cast type data based on the wand's 3 motion sensors which the game recognizes but ultimately went unused.

Some wands do contain an IR receiver which the game can use to force a cast back from the wand, but this also went unused for the most part.

Universial on the other hand is just pattern recognition, it was their way of replicating the HP style of casting, and getting around our patents (which they opted to not license).

It looks like they already have it. I have no idea what FAPs are or how they are Loaded, but i have to suppress a giggle every time. 

In the recent RM release, if you untar the resources.tar onto your SD card, FAP Loader by default looks in the apps dir on the sd card. There are a bunch of apps like BarCode creator, Mouse Jiggler, and several games including Life, Mandelbrot, Dice, TicTacToe. 

I found that playing with the barcode generator, it was interesting to see how the barcode changes as you modify the numbers. With these, the Flipper is much more usable as an idler tool for easily distracted minds like mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-27
Correct me if I'm wrong, but probably the reason that  subghz is not capturing this (besides setting incorrect freq. and fm/am bandwidth) is because Flipper doesn't know how to decode the frames (start/end, payload).

You can try RAW capture as mentioned but if the remote is using rolling codes it might be a problem.
-------------------------------

None of the projects available can do this. Cracking passwords requires significant resources. 

There are tools that will aid you in getting the hash to crack with something like Hashcat but don't expect the flipper to crack passwords. It doesn't really have the adequate processing power to do it.

Check out Wifi Penetration Tool on my GitHub 
https://github.com/FroggMaster/ESP32-Wi-Fi-Penetration-Tool

This would get you started.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-27
I don't think simple replay works with classic. The flipper has to answer like its a transponder. When using the emulate it kinda feels like the emulate is hardcoded and only ever shows the hard coded transponder but with the uid of the transponder you just scanned. I just added a piece of text in Ascii to see if the flipper can read it. It still only says 10b2 in every block of every sector at the start.

Not quite sure and non-technical terms used : Might be that MiFare is about a bit of security so there is an exchange between the phone and the "card", if you just copy what the "card" responded to the phone, it won't be correct since the "question" asked by the phone change each time

No and no. 

It's a separate add on board. And communication goes over gpio.
The stock firmware doesn't have any "programs" for it. 

You also need to flash the esp32 with the firmware you want to be running.
Tip: have a look at esp32 merauder firmware for some easy fun. There are also a bunch of YouTube videos on all this stuff.

That looks neat, but remind me - how exactly does this differ from using F0 with the android app over BT? 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-27
Thanks! I already found those, but not yet had the chance to try them out. Anyway I imagine, it would be just some presets - I still wat to make custom app to adjust settings on the go. My AC works that way that you select all the settings on the remote with LCD (temp., fan speed, humidity, mode, etc.), and then you send it via IR to the receiver as long string of commands.

been digging further. You don't need to mess with the source zipfile. In the daily release, there is a file called resources.tar and it has all kinds of .sub files and infrared.. basically all the files you need. Untar that (7z or winzip might help if you do windows) onto your sd card. All the apps for FAP Loader are in the apps directory. 

Universal remote actually has a useful defult with a the tesla codes and the handicpped door.

Sometimes it's an error on the flipper side. If you have FlipperOS loaded currently a quick reboot could work, if not then rebooting to recovery or resetting USB in Debug settings has helped me before.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Once you see all the other goodies in that directory, you might want to copy them all onto your flipper. For more than a few, you might really like to put the SD card into your computer and copy them over. It's kind of tedious especially since it doesn't remember where you were the last file you uploaded, at least on my Mint Linux system this is the case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
  
If you download the RogueMaster source zip, you are looking for the fap files.  
./assets/resources/apps/APPS\_BarcodeGenerator.fap  
(there are other apps and games in the same directory)  
Connect your flipper to your laptop, and using the qFlipper app you can transfer these one at a time to your SD card.  
Once you've done that, go to the menu and find the FAP Loader. Browse the SD card until you find the APPS\_BarcodeGenerator.fap that you uploaded earlier.  
From the barcode\_generator/README.md:  
This is a UPC-A Barcode generator for the flipper zero hardware.  
&lt;img src=https://i.imgur.com/bMSAiuK.png&gt;  
It will eventually be expanded in to other barcode types. It currently only generates UPC-A type barcodes.  
It does not perform any safety or sanity check. It simply converts the 12 digit number input in to the UPC-A barcode standard.  
I haven't tested this with any true barcode scanners, but I have used it with numerous mobile phone apps and it seems to work just fine (when the barcode passes the sanity check built in to the UPC-A standard)  
&lt;img src=https://i.imgur.com/bxTdzuA.png&gt;  
&lt;b&gt; -Controls- &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/br&gt;  
Hitting the centre button on the flipper toggles edit mode.  
When in edit mode, left and right will change the digit to be changed, and up and down will adjust the digit value.

Ok, I have learned the hard way to always have my Flipper with me.. :(

I was today at a Lady Gaga concert, and they used the Pixmob bracelets. So it would have been very simple to get the signals in my Flipper, If I had it with me.

So if somebody goes to a Lady Gaga concert, take a moment to record the IR signals. Then I can use the bracelets at home. :)

This is nice, but getting rid of the lock on your front door isn't as good of a solution (depending on the goal) as cloning a key when a friend of yours needs to be able to get into your home.

I actually do security work on RFID systems like the badge systems at office buildings. There are a lot of decisions to be made with those systems. For example: if you require the backend to access the card for verification, it takes longer for people to unlock the door. It's only a few seconds, but your brain notices. And when your office has a policy that every single person must badge in rather than holding the door open, you'll see annoyance grow. But, that also means that it's much harder to clone the card with a flipper or similar device.

On the other hand, if you let the door just allow the door to check the card serial number (that's how it works) then someone can easily clone the card and play back the same serial number. (Some types of programmable RFID cards even have programmable serial numbers!)

I mentioned above that the Clipper system in the San Francisco area requires tagging on and off the train. Here's what that looks like: [https://imgur.com/a/GBZLsIm](https://imgur.com/a/GBZLsIm)

You can see the main card info: It's a [Mifare DESFire](https://www.mifare.net/en/products/chip-card-ics/mifare-desfire/) (probably) which is an EMV type card. (**E**urocard, **M**astercard, **V**isa are the three companies that invented the standard. The top is then what the DESFire reading application returns. There's 1 application (the wallet) and 8 data files. Those data files contain among other things, the money you have, some recent trips, and backups of each. The last image is an android app called [FareBot](https://codebutler.github.io/farebot/) which can read those files. In that screenshot, you can see that on Jan 26th, I took a trip from Millbrae station to Embarcadero station on BART that cost me $5.05. (This seems most like your system where you have to tag in and out at the turnstiles.) On Sept 12th, I took a trip on Caltrain. Caltrain has a Zone station, and no turnstiles. Several stations exist in each Zone and you pay a base amount of $3.20 + $2.25 for each additional Zone you go through. (They had 50% discount during the height of COVID.) And since there are no turnstiles, you're responsible for using a tagging station on the train platform. Lastly, you can see $2.05 for bus fare. The buses you pay a fee of $2.05 and can ride for 2 hours, though that timer reset each time you transfer to a new bus.

If you are interested, you can take a look at the Farebot code repo to see how the files are read and turned into the data you see in the app. But the real magic happens each time you tap your card on the reader. Because the readers all have access to a secret key that can be used to update the data on the card. Without this key, the card remains locked in a read-only state. That's how the transit agencies take money from your wallet: they literally have the key to change the number on your card. (There's also some connections to backend systems so that they know if you added money online or bought a pass through a different system.) But ultimately, the card contains everything they need to decide whether you can pay for a trip or not. The system is designed to work without connectivity; many of the buses around here only connect to the backend when they return to the depot for refueling and shift changes. 

Interesting side-note: the Clipper system also allows your card to carry a negative balance for some trips because of the way some of the transit agencies do billing. Caltrain, for example, charges you for the maximum ticket price from wherever you start, then gives you a credit for the difference when you tag off. This way, if someone rides to the end of the line and forgets to tag off, Caltrain still gets their full payment. I once forgot to tag off and at midnight a $12 ticket was finalized when I would have only paid $3.20 if I'd remembered!

I was almost to Lvl2 and I tried a firmware that cleared me back to zero. Bummed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
I hear that it's a really Awesome Flipper Repository....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
That's correct. 

One of the unofficial firmwares is working on a feature to load a custom name from file too. 

Maybe this will find it's way to the official firmware also.

apple pay is far more complex and it's stated in the doc that digital cards don't work, I'll try my credit card next time I'm shopping
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
same here, only my bank cards, which is pretty shocking tbh
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
I guess I may have to convert over then, Unleashed is useful if you travel to other countries
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
The restrictions are in place for a reason, we do not assist with breaking the law.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Awesome! Take your time, I'm still learning from a non-technical perspective.

I'm able to read one of my condo card but another condo card was totally unreadable - I even tried reading those small key fob which was duplicated but still unreadable, not so sure why.

My work staff pass can be read by NFC but I guess too high security, the keys were not found in f0 database at all lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Looks great, A break down on your process would be appreciated. Would love to do the same. Hack The World!

You're missing the time it would take to transfer data

The delay introduced will cause the communication to time-out
-------------------------------

Yeah. those of us playing with it are all kickstarter backers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
I bought it too...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Just got mine too in SG.

leave to learn how to do a lot of the stuff you mentioned.

Managed to read condo card that is Mifare\_ultralight (tested working). Work staff pass is Mifare Classic 1K that took about a minute to decode. Haven't try if it works yet.  


Seriously impressed.

Just installed RogueMaster but somehow i still get the blocked frequency error message
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Is there a list anywhere indicating which frequencies are blocked where?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Will do sir, thank you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Not from what I read, RM offers apps, unleash unlocks frequency limits, totally different.   RM install didn't really work for me after a stock firmware update..  now all apps say error reading.  My SD card might not work, I guess the slow SPI makes card compatibility silly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Oh great, thanks for the info!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Dont they both basically do the same thing? Just a few different applications
-------------------------------

Close that terminal and run qflipper using sudo.   
Just run sudo ./qFlipper-x86\_64-1.1.0.AppImage then enter your password and you should be okay.  
I hope this helps.

I have the unleashed firmware with a few extra Dumps of SubGHz and IR and NFC files, but cant seem to find the barcode generator anywhere?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
yes, it is not on the stock firmware, but you should be able to find some alternative firmware repositories on a quick google search that have the barcode generator and more stuff to play with (=
-------------------------------

I did the exact same thing with our old boombox remote, pulled out my power supply and screwdriver and captured that bad boy's swan song of IR codes (=

I was able to clone my HID branded work badge (RFID), and get into the building no problem.

You shouldnt have any issue as long as its a bland RFID, or NFC based access process!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-26
Go to sub GHz, frequency analysis, press remote, find your frequency on flipper.
Go to read raw, now you need to test the coding.
First read with AM$biggestnumber -&gt; record replay -&gt; does not work, try same in config with FM$biggestnumber

u/jakobyscream O that's cool and thanks! I totally forgot to say rad PL as well and I totally agree on some of the RR techniques could use some tuning. I had to make a folder just for RR's in my repo as there's already 10 different win alone variations I found and mirrored an will probably use only 2-3 of them. In the spirit of it pulling scripts on keyboard attacks is kinda cheating, but ultimately in the end do you want results or to be some kind of purist snob? I for one want results, so who cares! Writing crazy one liners is fun but just because you can doesn't mean you should. You can shoot a fly with a cannon ball or swat it with a newspaper, gimme the newspaper lol. I got a flag you can plant in winland since that's more of your style. [Winpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) The win privilege escalation awesome scripts or winpeas for short pulls a disgusting amount of info from your system and prods every exploitable attack vector in your system and hands them to you on a silver platter with links to documentation of each one with info on how to leverage it. I shit bricks when I read the report on the linpeas version for the first time. Reading up on exfil techniques maybe base64 encode the report then EBCDIC encode it, AES 256 it and send it as DNS requests(with sleep included so it's not a blast). I am going to try to work on some more advanced stuff like that on the linux side but there's an idea for a flag for you to plant.

From reading other posts in this thread : the US model uses 315MHz ; the EU model uses 433.920, and [both of these are legal](https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/frequencies) in the US, which has the largest set of frequencies available.

The reason the EU model uses 433.20 is because 315 is illegal there, and because that is what remote keys use there.

315Mhz is [commonly used](https://www.solidremote.com/blog/rf-remote-control-frequency-selection-315mhz-418mhz-433-92mhz-or-915mhz/) for remote keyless entry in the US and is _not_ exclusive to Tesla.

We have a 30+ year old garage door opener at work, and I have to use Unleashed if I want to use my flipper to open it. So that made my decision. The community as a whole, though, is remarkably proficient and great at building on each other's findings.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
You're right. I was thinking of trying to do this with IR so I could macro my 3 remotes to turn on, switch input and mute the soundbar as I usually do.  But yeah it's better off being able to use saved stuff from different signal types, a core OS feature and they might have to make things more modular or add an API for the different types.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
Why can't we mitm a reader to get this key?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
You don't have to commit to any one, it's easy enough to switch back and forth. Your data on the SD card isn't really affected. Pay attention to what you like because it's possible to copy some functionality over with some C programming. I'd say try the stock firmware for a couple days and then try one of the others for a few days, go back to stock, and try the other. The differences are subtle but it's definitely worth trying them. it's always dirt simple to go back to the stock firmware. If it gets bricked, find out how to put it in recovery mode and reload again, start over.
-------------------------------

Can emulate your pack and essentially never die/get unlimited points. The flipper becomes the phasor. Can also change the colours of the packs too...

The color is really like that. Not a cheap shiny plastic.

I was curious if these displays are hardwired or not
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
Yes, you can dip it for sure. Just use at least 5-6 layers on it. I used Plast-i-dip for the rims on my Tesla. It lasted 2 years now norwegian winter. Just do it right, and dont touch it with any chemicals.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
Depends what you want, plug-ins or code grabber things. Personally I have a fork of unleashed that I added some RM plug-ins to
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
I was there too, couldn't do anything with it, so I flashed it to use MarauderOTA as described here : 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_YLTpNo5xa0&amp;ab\_channel=JustCallMeKoko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YLTpNo5xa0&amp;ab_channel=JustCallMeKoko)

  
One of the key think is to have arduino IDE communicating you have to install serial drivers and also to click on 'boot' button while you plug it on your computer.

  
(And I just found out the board doesn't plug correctly while using the silicon case)

  
Anyway I am still stuck at the same point at this moment and when I go to plugin/wifi scanner on flipper, it says attach wifi module.

  
Will let you know if any progress ;)

Transmission limitations are based on your location, basically each country has different rules and regulations concerning amateurs using certain frequency ranges of the radio spectrum.

Flipper has been made and configged to comply with your local radio laws, so transmission on a certain set of frequencies is disabled.

I actually wanted to ask a similar question, but for infrared. My TV- and stereo set need to be muted simultaneously, but use different protocols. Have them both recorded, one is raw, the other SIRC. So macros would be nice...

If booth were raw, I could probably just concatenate them, but, alas, I can't tell the "learn new remote function" to force reading raw.

But you can see differents here. The best is possibility to clone dynamic encryptions (both firms). But remember, in the most cases is illegal remove tx limitations:
 https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero/blob/main/Firmwares.md

Now, my recommendation as you ask:  Explore the official firmware, wait for ver.1.0 this Q3 2022 for more features, but keep it legal. I copy with raw feature some dynamic code with partial success... And I only have mine for a week...

Good luck, and "Hack the world"

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
That sounds like a script you are after. Basically you want all your devices or signals in one folder. Then write your own program/app maybe to do a playlist of all that's in that folder. 

I'm sure you could someone from discord channel to request it as an option or feature to be implemented.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-25
And how do you handle every time you add a new device to your routine? You need to save the macro again when new device comes to your house ;)

Raw recordings - this is how I currently trigger our gate to open, wait, close.

How can install this on Windows10?

Exactly. I just made it as quick and convenient as possible. But to be fair you shouldn't trust people from the internet, but if they are that worried then yea just fork it and modify it for your own use. I don't mind, encourage it even. Good on you for learning g enough to make your own variation

It looks like you shared an AMP link. These should load faster, but AMP is controversial because of [concerns over privacy and the Open Web](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/ehrq3z/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot). Fully cached AMP pages (like the one you shared), are [especially problematic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/ehrq3z/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot).

Maybe check out **the canonical page** instead: **[https://blog.flipperzero.one/certification-and-opening-sources/](https://blog.flipperzero.one/certification-and-opening-sources/)**

Ultralight C uses 3DES mutual authentication, so if you can't read the entire card, you're probably not going to be able to anyway. Full read is currently not implemented in Flipper. While it reads pretty much the same as a regular NTAG203 if no authentication needed, I'm not sure there's anything in Flipper currently that can do 3DES.

&gt;Does the flipper support Ultralight C Mifare cards? I was ... able to see the first 4 blocks of data

Feels like you answered your own question since you were able to get _some_ data.

&gt; but I am not sure if the key is a non-standard one or not.

Probably.  Any system being used for access _should_ be using non-standard keys and locking down access.  Not every system does, but they really should.

&gt;Any help or info about the Ultralight C type Mifare cards would be appreciated!

There are lots of docs out there about MFU, including the intro details on the flipper blog post: https://blog.flipperzero.one/rfid/.  If there are things you've read you don't understand, I'd suggest starting with specific questions.

Ex Game Tech here. You could only modify the credit amount if you hack (and modify) into the database that controls that info. The cards just check the balance (valid user + valid credit amount to request = gameplay and subtract game credit amount from user total) to the database (on server in very top of building usually)

It's using Mifare classic with default passwords, and no data stored on the card. It uses the card's UID to look up credits and tickets won in a database, so no way to add credits to the card, without somehow hacking into the database, or getting access to the employee computer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-24
Possible. I work at an arcade with similar systems, and it is possible that you might be able to hit someone else's UID to steal their credits. We also use "test cards" which are just regular cards with a ton of freeplay days on them. If you found the ID to one of those, you could play the games for free. As for prizes, if you could clone the UID to a magic card, and then make it look like the real card, the employee might not notice. Some arcades also have redemption kiosks, where you can scan your card, and select a prize based on the number of tickets you have, no human interaction needed. (I've yet to see one of these personally, as they are quite pricey)

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-24
This is correct about the database, it just uses the card's UID. (It's a Mifare classic with default keys and no data in the sectors) As for the old cards, I still have a few, and they were either barcodes with an ID number, or magstripes with the same.

When Fedex Office used to be Kinko's, they used contact chip cards that stored the card value on the chip, and it was protected by a PIN that was the same at ALL locations! Some hackers figured it out, and were able to load hundreds of $$ on the cards. The cards were used to pay for copies, and computer time, but could also be cashed out!
-------------------------------

Does anyone have technical documentation on how these arcade card readers work? A basic Google search shows a lot of folks trying to sell me card readers and doesn't have so many results telling me how they actually work.

Iirc you still need to brute force a small key and reverse engineer the primary key of the card by removing the chip grinding it down and looking through a microscope. So it's not as simple as you make it sound. You would have to emulate the key physically embedded in the card which can not be read or outputted.

Yes, i noticed that.  
I mean, did you really wanna use software that heavily rely on downloadable scripts?  
What happens if you don\`t have internet or your ISP or evil russian hackers crack your wi-fi (yes, i know Https via TlS1.2 still uncrackable, but what if it attacks on downgrade tls protocol, like robot)?  


Sorry if i was too rough on you.  
I would preffer smth like this  
`(New-Object -Com Shell.Application).Open('`[`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc)`')`  


So in the end it should be   
`GUI r`   
`DELAY 500`   
`STRING C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "(New-Object -Com Shell.Application).Open('`[`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc)`')"`  


P.S. if we talk about Powershell and one-liner try to use magic powershell pipeline.  
P.P.S. btw shell,[application.open](https://application.open) use default application for https:// protocol so you don\`t need to find any available browsers for this user.

But in that case, if only the UID is checked, then the credentials are a bit weak. I know that proxmarks can bruteforce uids directly on the reader for instance. Additional sectors should be used to perform the authentication. Of course, I can be wrong.

You need to modify [line 79](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/7c49f604f986f13790051822c72ae7de1730827c/applications/dolphin/passport/passport.c#L79) in `applications/dolphin/passport/passport.c`. Instead of `const char* my_name = furi_hal_version_get_name_ptr();` you can just hard code the name (`const char* my_name = "my new name";)`

Note that this change doesn't actually change the name (the name is basically the device's serial number) but it only changes it in the passport (right from the main menu). There are a few more places where the name is used (such as the "about" menu), but those are less significant. You can find all uses of `furi_hal_version_get_name_ptr` with something like `git grep` and just replace it with a string :)

OK perhaps I should have worded it different but the point being conveyed is that it can fit in the run box so it's short enough I don't have to open an actual powershell window
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
I mean, this is nice and all but its only a one liner because you are concatenating multiple commands/lines with `;`, which is kinda cheating. 

You could take those multi line ps1s and replace `/r/n` with ` ; ` and youd end up with 1 line.

Yea was gonna say, old systems? Yes. Chances are if the system is old enough, the way the swipe card works is that it has the data (balance etc.)on the card and the deduction is made via the swipe and the machine editing the cards data. But anything that also holds virtual tickets? That is gonna be a dead giveaway the data is not held on the card (think about how the card would get the info that you got tickets if you didn't swipe the card after your game)

Nowadays it really is just a username, the database keeps track of balance and tickets etc. You can still use it, but no way to "edit" the balance on the card as it isn't stored there.

Thanks, Ive tried waiting, indeed it takes a bit long to search all sectors.  However, even after searching all sectors, it still found only 2 keys, and in the info page it shows no different than a quick normal read.  Did I do anything wrong?  Tomorrow Ill try if this completely scanned NFC works or not, and post it here.

Well, telling them that you've visited the local post office twice isn't very useful without stating the conclusion of those visits as well. Did they tell you your package is lost, and you should contact the seller? Or did they tell you your package is delayed, but will still arrive later? Or did they tell you something completely different?

Additionally, considering the people behind Flipper aren't American, they might not be aware that the post office is directly affiliated with USPS, and USPS isn't some random package delivery company. This might all just be down to a miscommunication due to that fact.

Hence the community outreach part of what I said. I know how the flipper works lol, if you would stop being condescending you would understand my point completely.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
.... I literally just explained it to you. What you are proposing is a skeleton key. One device to access x number of readers that all use multiple RFID protocols. 

To do what you are proposing would require all business to provide you with a PHYSICAL copy of each key card required to access a facility. "Read raw" does not somehow sniff the receiver of an access point. It sniffs the transmission of a key (HID, one-touch, whatever). Even IF you could read through stored procedure all the keys you were provided the transmission of any number of those RFID frequencies is prohibited in the US to stop WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING. This is not my hypothesis. This is not a theory. It's documented any number of times in RFCs that the Flipper community has pointed to since its release.

In fact, the whole point of flashing with custom firmware is to unlock the restriction flags placed on US Flipper hardware. Can you flash your own firmware? Yep. Is it illegal? Yep. 

You have no idea what you're talking about. You look like a fool. Stop while you're ahead.

Whatever you say dude. Community outreach is super important, and Im not gonna argue with you. I work in EMS and the flipper has come in handy more times than I can count. To each their own I guess
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
The system goes to a central server to look up your card's balance. I think the only way to get "unlimited" is if you manage to capture an employee card. I only tested with my own card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Yes, but you're wrong. Community outreach means nothing. "Read Raw" is not a free pass and you're going to run into a higher failure rate in emulation than you think. There are restrictions in the US in RFID channel frequencies and a good amount of signal readers that you're talking about use rolling codes to protect the sort of thing that you're proposing.

Basically you're going to sell a bill of goods and then fail at opening a device because the RFID frequency is restricted. This is not a free access pass for a reason.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
i understand the cards use some type of nfc signal to communicate with the machines, but can you use the flipper emulate unlimited amounts of money on the flipper to get as many plays as you want?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Yeah, obviously. A lot of businesses have Knox keys and others have RFID entry capability. Business complexes and apartment complexes have gates that could be opened using the read raw feature. See where Im going with this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
It appears to be a unique identifier, no record of credits available (or tickets earned, they are virtual now) on the card itself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Its a face OwO
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
... what are you talking about? Even with the community you'd still need each business to provide you with an actual physical device to emulate. I'm not arguing the practicality of what you're offering. I'm arguing the technical limitations. No matter what you propose you will still need a physical device to emulate and that device may or may not be supported by Flipper Zero hardware/firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Hard disagree. As a firefighter in a community, all you have to do is a little bit of outreach with businesses and complex management. Shouldnt be hard to engage with the public and get out in the community to let them know quicker access means faster extinguishment of fires and better outcomes and medical aids.
-------------------------------

can you modify the amount of credits you have, in theory being able to play for free. is this through nfc?

You're welcome. In hindsight if you're interested in an infosec or coding career path Flipper Zero wouldn't be a bad device to start playing with. If you purchased it solely for reading the source code and practicing development you probably couldn't ask for a better platform. You literally cannot brick the device via coding errors. You can just force a hard reset and start from stock firmware.

I still recommended NOT buying Flipper as a turn-key solution for non-forcible entry. But for a tech sandbox? Do it. You will find the community on Discord to be amazing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
This is where the reality of Flipper Zero is probably still not what OP will be able to use in a situation where non-forcible entry is the end result. You'd have to have access to clone a token or access card for each location you're interested in accessing assuming that the protocol is supported for read and emulation. That kind of functionality isn't a scan/roll scenario.
-------------------------------

125khz RFID and NFC are completely different things, so no wonder the RFID read didn't work.

You need to read the tag completely, not just its UID. Too that you need to use the "Run special action" menu. After that, you'll need to wait for all 32 or 80 keys to be found, and only after that you'll be able to properly emulate it.

Mifare Classic is an NFC tag. But emulating the UID is not going to fool most readers, you'll have to emulate all the data, too, and that only works if you have the sector keys (or can crack them).

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
They still write to and read from the card. For example, BART cards in northern California record nearly every trip taken, even when you have a monthly pass. Several of our monthly passes are region specific so the entrance turnstile writes where you got on, then the exit turnstile checks that your trip between entrance and exit stayed in the region where your pass is valid. Lastly it writes a "closing" transaction that costs $0 if your pass applies.

The entrance and exit transactions are also used by transit police to catch fare-jumpers. If you're on a northbound train and you don't have a recent entrance transaction from a southern station, you're busted.

I always recommend C as your starting language. There are other, easier languages to learn like Python but for general use that is still functional everywhere C is your best friend. Typically if you're interested in infosec I'd likely start with Security+ and Pentest+ certifications. Neither will break the bank, both are good introductory certs, and both will help you decide first if you even like doing the kind of work you'll be doing. You can install a copy of Kali Linux while you study Pentest+ and get familiar both with Linux/Unix and the tools you'll be reading about in both courses.

Then, you can always make and capture your presets from the existing remotes, but I would like to be able to change different settings in my flipper without recapturing the new settings over and over again.

In the early 90s with hardware repair. A+ certification so I could do vendor warranty work. I stood behind a repair bench doing mind numbing repair work. From there I just kept expanding. Contracting installing different IDS and firewall hardware when both technologies were relatively new. Then I left contracting to work in the finance industry as entry level infosec around 2000. Spent 9 years there working in HP-UX environments and learning C to support those environments. Left that in 2009 to begin assessing code used in payment terminals, assessing financial backend systems, and assessing P2PE environments. Still doing that 13 years later.

Okay kids, harmless messing with people's cars is fun, but just remember that not everyone has to be understanding and/or tolerant to this kind of fun. So beware of prudes and sticklers and don't let anyone see you stand near strangers cars with strange devices in your hands - for god's sake at least use screen streaming to your phone, don't look directly at your target and don't start to giggle immediately after the flap opens... Just sit on a nearby bench, leave your flipper in your bag oriented towards your target, and just play inconspicuously with your phone...

With the Flipper you can only copy and emulate UID not the data stored inside the NFC.

But you can dump the tag via Proxmark3 than convert the JSON dump into .nfc format for Flipper! So now you can emulate the TAG with original stored data.

maybe you could also add a note on them in the shop faq at https://flipperzero.one/faq
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
No way around this. No Desfire vulnerability exists.

Also, the unleashed firmwares (muddlebox etc) unlock RF in your region (for sub ghz) this is unrelated to NFC/RFID.

Some of these firmwares come with additional apps for rfid or some extended dictionaries that search for keys (eg Mifare classic keys) but none of the firmwares can currently do more elaborate attacks on the flipper. 

Get a proxmark3 Easy 512 if you want to start learning about RFID. They are like $40 and allow you to do all sorts of attacks, cloning etc for not HF and LF tags. But cant do much with Desfire yet unfortunately.

Thats because Desfire has very strong encryption for the data on the card. Flipper is only reading and emulating the UID, not the rest of the card (which is the important bit).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Me too!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Yeah, I can read and emulate, but the emulation doesn't work...

Very nice detailed explanation I really appreciate it Astra. Thank you!
-------------------------------

The flipper can only read unencrypted (public) data on the card. You can't read the encrypted data from the card because you need to authenticate with the card before it will give you the data, that's the whole point. The decryption keys are stored on the card and on the reader.

That's how that works approximately:
Reader powers card on
Reader authenticates using its key (the key itself is never transmitted, they only transmit an already encrypted message to prove that both sides have the key to decrypt it'll
Reader requests to read the data from an app
The card checks if that key is allowed to read that data
If so, the card returns the data, encrypted in transit with that key, and the reader decrypts it.


And the exact encryption parameters are random every time (negotiated at auth), so you can't just sniff the communication and replay the encrypted data, as it will be incorrect the next time around.

TLDR Flipper reads the unencrypted part, you can't request the encrypted one from card unless you have the key
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Then you need to completely read the card via the "Run special action" menu in the NFC app. That will probably take some time, and you need to find all 32 or 80 keys (depending on your card) for it to be emulated properly.

More than two years since Kickstarter. Corona, Chip crisis, 4 weeks in the Customs in the netherlands and now it is 5 delivery stops away.
-------------------------------

Thanks for the explanation. I see flipper does have a function to read these cards, what is that used for if the card is encrypted? Also why can't we just clone the encrypted contents of the card and emulate it ? Or does the card decrypt it self somehow when used? I don't understand that part. Who holds the decryption key and who decrypts the data?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
How long did it take from order to delivery?
-------------------------------

Do you have a proxmark3? Would be fun to see what you can do with it.

Its a mifare classic. Heres what Wikipedia said about it:

The card technology is MIFARE Classic.[1] The card has a 4 kilobyte electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) which can be written to using RFID. The card also contains a chip by NXP Semiconductors which implements a proprietary cryptography scheme called CRYPTO1, which was fully reverse-engineered in 2008.[1] A Practical Attack on the MIFARE Classic was published in 2008 by a group at Radboud University Nijmegen.[1]

The ride history is stored on the card unencrypted and can be read by anyone. There are mobile apps made by third parties which can achieve this.[2]





The ride history thing looks interesting though, I might take a stab at doing a plug-in around that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
They have strong cryptography that hasn't yet been cracked, you can't extract the data needed for emulation without knowing the correct key, and the dictionary attacks are basically impossible due to how long the key is.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Its a mifare classic, but found some info that points to why it didnt work:

The card technology is MIFARE Classic.[1] The card has a 4 kilobyte electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) which can be written to using RFID.

I got it off of lab401 after spending the past year regretting I didnt get in on the KS. I know thats frustrating for folk, as I understand it kickstarter fulfillment can be super difficult internationally. Hopefully well get more dolphins in DK soon!

Why can't DESfire be emulated if I may ask?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Its a mifare classic according to Wikipedia (and flipper IDed it correctly) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejsekort
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Any other colors potentially down the road?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
These cards are more than just an identifier. They have a microprocessor in there and an encryption key that _ideally_ you won't be able to access without breaking the card. What you can read with the Flipper is what the card will tell you, but that's not enough to actually clone the card.

It is theoretically possible to get the key still, and you could use the Flipper for that, but then you'd be a security researcher finding a flaw in the chips that no-one has found so far, and you'd probably make a lot more by reporting it properly than you could by using it for travel.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
I made the mistake and chose the white because I liked it more. I think my brain omitted the part that the black version was for backers only. :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
That's not how NFC works at all
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
You are emulating the UID of the card, not the full card contents. If it's a DESfore card, it can't be emulated.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Yes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Sydney Australia train transport cards do not work either, believe it is a hardware thing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Man I feel you. I'm just a pathetic pre-orderer, not even a Kickstarter backer, but I'm just as frustrated by now...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
Its just emulating UID. Original card is probably Desfire. If it is, no chance of you cloning and emulating it in the foreseeable future.

When you scan the card with flipper, what app does it want you to run? Desfire? Mifare Ultralight? Mifare Classic?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
+1
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-23
You're in Denmark and you got yours??? Where's mine then?! Happy for you though! But seriously, where's my flipper!!! 

Regarding the card, as far as I know you both need to have the right credentials on the card so the terminal can validate it with the server, and you also need the terminal to be able to update the content of the card.
I think. I could be wrong though.
-------------------------------

Possible they use some kind of rolling code.

I can't emulate my garage door opener for this same reason, but I've read things that make me think that deciphering the rolling code might be possible

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Many metro cards store the "wallet" onboard (or validate it with a backend). So the Flipper likely couldn't complete a deduct money transaction or confirm your checkin.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
I've two black Flippers. I'd like to get an extra casing and airbrush, or dip it to make a more unique case eventually. 

Then laser engraving for extra personalization.

Can you still copy and replay arbitrarily long signals, like an AC might have, say 20 bytes (160 bits)?
-------------------------------

If you check now it says what countries it will specifically ship to
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Yeah, i must have just missed out, i looked 2 days ago and tried to pre-order for the aug shipment and it was just nope, to any of the addresses, the wording on the site, makes it sound like they are no longer going to ship to the US, not that the current US warehouse shipments are sold out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
That's because they are out of USA stock, ended like 2 days ago I check it daily and post when the shop is live again
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
I have the US one I think, need to find EU ones. Otherwise all the buttholes in the neighbourhood are safe (for now)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Aaah, that now makes sense as to why i cant ship, wording on the site is a little vague as to why.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Where were you able to order from, flipperzero.one wont ship to my address.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
I was talking with my BF about emulating our public transport cards. The thing you used to checkout with looks very much like our checkin posts. I will try this weekend to emulate mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Oh man, if there ever was a use for a flipperzero at my house this is it, I have about 30-40 candles, all bought at different times so i have different remotes and its a PITA to find which remotes turn on which candles.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Was curious to see if this might work (and it didnt).

Checked in with the physical card, but attempted to check out via emulation. It didnt work, but unclear as to why not? Would love some hints to understand more.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
My Mach-E only requires to push the charge port door for it to open. I guess I should be worried with people with hands lol. They could open the charge port **and leave it open** because unlike a Tesla, it doesn't auto close. I wish mine had auto open/close instead of the low tech push spring mine has.
-------------------------------

Nope, I waited longer for the black :). It seems like people regret getting the white, tons of people dying them haha
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
It is absolutely security-related to the people who don't want it to happen.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
And how is that a security issue? What can they access through there beside the charge port and If they want to charge my car, be my guess lol.

Beside, If they really really want to get into the **charge port** without the owner's permission, like for any other car with a remotely operated trap door, all it takes is a few seconds with a flat head screw driver and it's opened. No need to reflash your flipper. On the Tesla, it won't even damage the charge port door. There is nothing security related there.
-------------------------------

Gotcha. Where did you start when you got into the tech world?

Actually, we're talking about strangers being able to open the port without the owner's permission.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Will do, thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
True. What I did after all the steps you did was to put flipper on usb uart mode, connected the wifi board on flipper and connected flipper on the pc. downloaded putty and connected on the COM port from flipper. After that I didnt see anything, then I pressed reset on the dev board, and finally it showed up the system..

Maybe you can give a shot

If you are not "tech savvy" this is probably not the device for you. You will be doing development of some kind if you want to expand on the stock, basic functions. This is not a turn-key tool.

I'm starting to wish they'd start nuking posts/comments glorying using Flipper for illegal things.

Flippers already managed to get a mention in our security briefings for Black Hat here in Vegas with the note that they're usable by people with little to no technical skills by just copying information off the Internet.

Not gonna be long before one of the bigger media outlets picks up the stories of people going around fucking with stuff that isn't theirs and places just start start banning them or even just that they'd bring attention on people just for having one.

Nobody?

You realize that hams literally have a game (called a fox hunt) where we locate low-power transmitters including competitions with moving transmitters.  It uses some pretty basic techniques anybody with a novice license can learn in an afternoon.  Thousands of people join fox hunt competitions all across the US every year.

I made this to try out code found here: [https://github.com/mothball187/flipperzero-nrf24](https://github.com/mothball187/flipperzero-nrf24) which is a poc of this:[https://www.bastille.net/research/vulnerabilities/mousejack/technical-details](https://www.bastille.net/research/vulnerabilities/mousejack/technical-details) for flipper.

Mine lasts 3-6 days when turned on. If yours doesn't, something's wrong. What firmware are you using?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Well, I've solved it.  
After many attempts and trying everything imaginable, I changed the network name and password in the code, compiled it, connected it to the FZ and in the end it let me connect and upload the file.

I actually ended up reaching out to them last week asking if I could preorder through them, then got a notice that they were in stock 5m after they told me they had no idea when they would be in.

Definitely feel for the kickstarter backers though  Ive been on that side before (with fellow coffee), and its frustrating even if the logistic reality did those companies does make sense.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Mine doesnt have updates either. EU wave 1, backer in the first 2k backer orders. The situation with Lab401 was really bad for backers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Will it need new hardware and a new purchase, or just firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
&gt;You sly business savvy mother fucker

I'd be that, it I'd actually pulled it off.

And I'd be glad.

But alas I didn't. Since I already pre-ordered, and don't have that much money to spend for a second flipper I won't really need, it is just the same waiting game for me.


Additionally, it'd be better overall. I'd have better warranty coverage, and if the unit was defective, the return and replacement process would be much easier, safer, and free, due to European laws governing this.

Oh well... I feel just a tiny bit ripped off. Really just a bit. But I do.

In the US, the mere deliberate interference of something which has a certified radio transmitter/receiver (like Teslas do) is a crime at the federal level.

That's before you get into state-specific crimes.

If it causes any damages (not literal physical damage, just causes any loss whatsoever), *then* it's a civil matter on top of the criminal matter.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
It is vulnerable. Wont be fixed, per Hondas replies to various questions.

Try it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Its the name for a mis-implementation of rolling codes. Normally codes only roll forward, but honda allowed the sequence to be reset when a valid lock followed by unlock is heard by the car. This means codes captured at any time can be re-used at any later time regardless of where the sequence is. Also negates the need for the jam part of rolljam.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Given that the Flipper is not certified for that frequency band in the US, its mere operation is illegal regardless of what you do with it.

The other devices you're talking about are irrelevant since you're not granted privileges on the frequencies they use; those *specific devices* are authorized to transmit on those frequencies.  The fact that your wireless doorbell operates on a specific frequency does *not* give you any privileges on that frequency aside from operating the doorbell.

Accepting unintentional interference is only requires of devices if the interference is both unintentional and authorized. Since operating someone else's Tesla without their permission is neither of those, you have no legal protections at all.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Yeah, that's the joke. I'm still waiting for mine. Have I been ordering from lab401 one flipper back to back as the last one arrived, I'd have like over 15 flippers overall. Which is a lot and shows just how slower "the official" route can be in contrast to resellers.

(Tbh if I'd knew for sure that lab401 will have flippers in the stock anyway, I wouldn't even preorder.

But nobody could even tell me. Hell, I've asked lab401 about the flipper screen protectors, wether they plan on ordering them eventually - of course I got answer "no frickin clue, but at an arbitrary day somebody up there can just one day order them from flipper devices, and it'll suddenly be in stock "

I bet they'll get them eventually!)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
The final EU batch is through customs. Youll have it within a week or so
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
Exactly what I did. Ordered from lab 401 last week and had in in 3 days.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
All the time I thought, ok with the update emails we got about the process of the production and it's problems, I would accept of the project fails since the insight redeemed the invest already.

But this is another level somehow. And feels bad :/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
My favorite joke is still the fact that in the Europe, you could just wait till the lab401 got flippers and then just order from them. You'd have gotten it even before half of the USA backers have got them.

It's not a security flaw, it's a feature that allows me to plug my car that I forgot to plug without having to unlock it first. It's for convenience, not for assholes to mess with. They could change the behaviour if there is enough complains about it but I hope it doesn't get to that because like I said, it's convenient.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-22
I don't think it is strong enough, nor should you do it because it is quite illegal and not a good use of a Flipper. From my research I found a system is called Opticom, I read up on it, I never delved into emulating or trying to capture the signal but without flipper I would know much less than I do now

Thanks for the hint. Didnt notice them when I originally found this repo.

Personally I use it to learn about tech. It leads me down rabbit holes about how rolling code works, what IR blasters cop cars use to change light signals, how to flash firmware, what I can read what I can't yada yada. This unfortunately leaves me bugging people to explain realtively simple stuff (to them) for me, luckily the community seems pretty patient and I'm just tech savvy enough

Lucky you. Here in the States this falls under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_Fraud\_and\_Abuse\_Act)

We recently saw the Governor of Missouri charge a reporter with hacking simply because he was inspecting the DOM tree or HTML source of a website which lead to his discovery of a major data leak of social security numbers, among other personal details. Even though the case was eventually dismissed, the reporter had one hell of a fight on his hands and will forever be listed in the NCIC database, meaning he won't be able to get certain types of clearances in the future.

Even if you \*think\* it's safe, never underestimate the powers of the government. If they even suspect you committing a crime, they WILL begin pulling records to build a profile on you.

Oh I didn't realise community managers were on Reddit!

I wonder if you can help us.

We had 2 flippers "delivered" but were never received from the dodgy delivery people Sendle employed in Australia.

Sendle is pretty bad here in Australia, and have many complaints about stolen stuff by their contractors.

We were part of the original funding more than 2 years ago and feel awful having waited all that time for it to be stolen by the courier.

We had seen CCTV from the unit administration that it was never delivered on the day it said it was, but even with that we had no recourse. They denied us insurance since they say it was delivered.

Their bullshit investigation was by the numbers and guarantee it was not conducted properly if at all, since we know it never arrived, and the driver/delivery person would have lied. They have no signature required or photo of delivery complete. 

Is there anything Flipper can do from your end? Tracking number for Sendle was 59CK4TG

In any case PLEASE use Australia Post instead of the cheap option. We waited soooooooo long and so disappointed.

Thanks for any advice.

So true story, and thanks for that info by the way, so I do not own a Tesla.  I plan to but nothing as of the time of this reply.  However I do own Flipper Zero and have copied the Tesla files onto it.  Have not found a single parked Tesla where I live, I suppose the trailer parks dont have charging stations like big cities.  Well regardless, I was on the interstate yesterday after work and just minding my own business when a Tesla slowly was approaching me.  Instantly I got excited and I reached for my Flipper Zero.  Pulled up the file and hit Send and nothing.  I did this for a while.  Like 5 full minutes expecting the charging door to pop open.  Nothing.  And honestly I assumed it was on the driver side but being unsure I changed lanes and tried for a couple more minutes.  Now having read that they get notified makes it even funnier to me thinking of what they could have possibly thought was wrong.  Oh well. Such is life.  I am still proud of myself for trying and not giving up.  Never quit.  Even if the driver is being alerted lol

The file shared is for the EU frequency. For US you need to change from 433.93 to I think 315 MHz through editing the .sub file. Works with stock firmware in the EU.

Don't know if you can reset it with the reset button on the board.

Otherwise you may have to reflash the firmware? Described here: https://github.com/flipperdevices/blackmagic-esp32-s2

Put this on the sd card in the subghz folder. 

For bonus internet points you can record the signal yourself at any tesla charger. 

It may require a frequency unlocked firmware im not shure.

As far as been able to find is pen testing tool , the idea world the tool would not be able to do anything to any device and be useless but because we dont live in perfect world you poke around and find what you can manipulate, I been playing around with the badusb feature and Harding my own network, ncf feature works on picking up cards and showing some information on it , been building some demo to show what it can do I plan to drop some. If was why you need one you probably dont need it. If you see it your brain starts running on all possible things you could do then it may be for you

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
All valid points.  I have seen several people say thou that it is illegal to transmit on that frequency, at least in the US. Tesla has some contract with the FCA, so they alone can use it.  That said I hadn't seen anything in my admittedly very quick google search

If your region allows it, you can transmit this with stock firmware. It works in North America.

As for being illegal, i am not aware of any law against it. Correct me if I'm wrong but the entire point of the frequency restrictions is to only allow the device to transmit on frequencies that you are allowed to transmit on. That is to say it is the same frequencies that are used by other devices you can own and control in order to make them broadcast at the time of your choosing eg wireless doorbell, weather station, RF remotes, etc. The thing is that Tesla decided not to use any sort of authentication in their device, so they all open on the same code. Who says i can't make my own remote control using the same code, and if it happens to interfere with a poorly-designed device, that is not my problem.

If my tv remote also controls my neighbor's tv, it's his problem.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
Not sure what kind of answer youre looking for here. You speak about HackRF. If youre familiar with the hardware and have looked at the firmware on GitHub o then you already know what it is capable of and should be aware if it is something that youre interested in. 

As far as you havent seen hacks I dont know what youre talking about. But I will also say that I think this device has more mainstream casual appeal and therefore many people who know little to nothing about tech have bought it. A friends brother of mine bought one hes a car salesman who just saw a YouTube video and bought it. Hasnt used it. With the firmware being unfinished there are a lot of people who know nothing about coding who cannot add anything to it. There is still quite a bit that is a work in progress.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
The HackRF does 1mhz to 6Ghz if I remember correctly. Thats a dedicated device for that purpose. Its also more expensive than the flipper. 

There are also better NFC and RFID dedicated devices. They are also more expensive than the flipper. 

You are comparing products that offer different feature sets in different form factors.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
but for the RF stuff a Nethunter paired with a HackRF Mayham seems to bring a bit more to the table for almost the same price?

I live in a smarthome and I hate talking to google to command things, since I already have the IR code for everything its super easy using it as an universal remote. Works with my frontdoor, my switch for amiibos, and if I ever get the dev board I'll use it for wifi pentesting even though its cheaper to get a pwnmagotchi
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
SSID scanning, and physical vulnerability. BadUSB tools are supported natively and there's a fair level of versatility if you can get your hands on the WiFi dev board.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
It sounds like it will sit in your draw? 

Seems you are looking for a reason to buy, when it seems you shouldnt. 

Rolling key support is supported in unofficial firmwares. There is a legal concern in that regard. It is an open source project. Features will continue to be added in time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
What country are you in? As the signals differ!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
RFID, NFC, Sub-Ghz are not used only in Russia. 

Firmware and sub protocol support is a work in progress. 

Technically anything working on those methods can be read and emulated. 

If that doesnt sound like enough to buy then dont?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
Like? Rolling keys, sub-ghz not up to par, NFC still buggie.. please enlighten me before I order, dont wanna end up with yet another device sitting In the drawer
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
Thats not the point, just trying to figure what it can be used for, since there is a big difference on the amount of old equipment In russia that it can be used on conpared to here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
Dont buy one then?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
There seems to be quite a bit you are missing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
Ok, finallyIi was able to install it apparently.  but the problem now is that when I try to connect to the wifi network, I get the network but it is impossible for me to connect to the network.  I have flashed the card several times and all the time the same, impossible to connect.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
It doesn't have WiFi, and a phone is better for SSID scanning. Coming from a blueteam perspective, the ability to clone building access cards or open gates would be a risk I want to know about, so could use this to prove those attack vectors.

How do you use it as a pentesting tool? Just SSID scanning? Or is there something Im missing here?

I totally agree, great for taking along on a holdiday to one of the xxxStan countries and play around in the country side, I think for the RF stuff you would be better of with a HackRF Portapack Mayham

See it's a tad more complicated.

So most of those conversations are old. 

In most cases it's not that I won't ever be allowed to talk about them. Time limited NDA's are a thing. 

Also most companies I've worked for don't like us claiming to work for them on social media/Reddit. So I can't tell people that WHILE I work for them. After, they can't stop me. 

Also, I can now talk about many of the projects I worked on and frequently do. 

I mean most of it's never been a secret. I have a LinkedIn that's not hard to find. I've got talks published from conventions and stuff. It's not actually an OPSEC issue, it's a "If I say the words 'I WORK FOR &lt;INSERT COMPANY HERE&gt; on Reddit' I'll get written up" kind of thing. So I can't say. But it's not OPSEC

What do you want to know? I can't tell you my current employer on Reddit (Policy) but I can tell you what I do. I can also tell you some of the supers I've worked on.

But yes, there are things that you can't even say you can't even say. And I wouldn't say that I can't say about things I can't say I can't say about because I can't do that.

If you are asking this you *probably* dont need this.

Flipper has a lot of tools that would usually come in multiple diffrent devices. Its like your phone. You wouldnt carry a clock, a calendar, a landline, multiple games, ...

But that means that you are already using some of the tools inside flipper in your life and might want to learn the other.

Flipper is also like an arduino but way smaller and easier to carry so you could do some fun projects while not home
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
to be absolutely honest.  I don't know.  I thought it would be pretty cool when i backed the KS.  But now i've had it a few weeks it's been sitting mostly unused.  
Most of the things sub-ghz don't work, since anything you actually want to play around with uses rolling codes which aren't supported. other than the tesla thing and that gets old after doing it a couple of times. 
IR stuff, i was doing that on my casio watch in the 80's
NFC - most stuff doesn't seem to be supported or if it is, cannot be cloned or anything useful with it. 

i suspect that if you were in russia like the people who made it, where it is MUCH more commonplace to see really old, unencrypted protocols, it would be much more use. 

my 2p worth.   hopefully people can change my mind as i'd love to use it
-------------------------------

If you had any idea of how OPSEC should work and you indeed couldnt tell, then it should not even be mentioned.

Moreover you have been completely unable to make a single reasonable argument as to why anybody should do this.

"Because I want to" isn't good enough.  It's illegal. Can lead to the car being damaged or the owner being put out. 

It's a dick move. Stop trying to justify doing it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
I never said it would directly damage the car.

You are opening a port that is supposed to be closed when not in use to prevent damage. 

I provided examples of things that HAVE happened to Tesla owners who opened their ports while at their cars. 

Please stop making strawman arguments, it's quite unbecoming
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
I see you are actively refusing to provide any information that it can cause physical harm to the car or the programming contained within it. You are making claims and not backing them up. That's fine, you do you, but I will not engage in your pointless circle arguments anymore. Have a day

You keep making a claim it will/can damage a Tesla.   A claim I haven't seen anyone else make, including in the articles I saw on this topic. Could you please explain how it could cause actual damage?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
It was most definitely an answer. Answering a question with another question is very normal. It's not my fault you were unable to reason about it. 

No it's not a stretch. 

And sure you can "look at the logs" but what does that actually mean to an owner? "So? Fix it". 

My entire point was, it's not funny unless the owner was a a friend and you were showing them.

Plus the legal implications. You cannot just walk up and pick a lock to a mechanically locked fuel cap. That is effectively what you are doing. The fact its electronic and involves a computer you might even be running afoul of the "unauthorised use of a computer" clause of some rules. 

But ultimately it boils down to the fact that it's at best something that goes unnoticed by everybody except you. At worst it could lead to inconvenience and property damage. 

There is no "harmless prank" here. It's stupid and irresponsible.  And kinda frustrating that a bunch of skiddys with no idea about OpSec or even just the basic idea that "Just because you can doesn't mean you should", now have the ability to do dumb shit for the lulz. That never ends well for the people who don't do dumb shit. 

Also, oh wow anecdotal evidence,  the gold standard for proof of lack of harm. Well my uncle smokes a pack or two a day and doesn't have cancer, so smoking is safe and cool. Please start.

First, that was not an answer; it was a general statement. Second, I have not been rude to you. Please do not use personal attacks; they will not have your desired effect.  

You're kind of stretching with that logic.  this is already entering the media; I've seen a few articles about people doing this. It's not causing damage, and all it'll take is a look at the logs to see it received the signal
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-21
That is an answer. 

But since your clearly not overly bright. The door closes for a reason. If it notifies them that it was opened, they will wonder why?

If it were me and I didn't know about the Flipper I would conclude there was a bug or fault and then try and get it looked at. So potentially having to take my car in and get it looked at and the time and bother of getting it looked at. 

Like thanks asshole.

In my opinion, you should use your Flipper for everything it has to offer. Especially the fun and silly things! Flipper was designed to be a tool for both beginners and experts. What better way to get someone into this hobby then for them to use it to pull fun and harmless pranks. It's not like it's hurting anyone...

As a Tesla and flipper owner initially I was amused by this but now it is annoying. This is approaching menace proportion. If all you can do with your flipper is to open charge ports, you probably aren't worthy to be in possession of such a fine multi-tool. The flipper can do so much more, yet there is delight at opening a charge port for a car you wished you had - that's the truth isn't it? C'mon. It is childish, find something more worthy to do with your flipper. Don't be a menace.   


I've spoken the truth. I know many don't like being called on their BS. I'd like to see real innovative things people have done with their flipper. THB I haven't even attempted to open my own charge port because I don't see the point. It is so dumb

Do you know if they'll start to sell in the US again?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Just tried to order from the August batch, told me it couldn't ship to the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
They aren't currently selling more in the U.S with this latest stock update
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Sure af better be. I bought one a couple weeks back.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Yes I am having this problem in US and I'm just trying to order a some accessories (case, screen protector, boards). We gotta wait for shipping rotation to order?

It took me about 30 days to get mine after I got that shipment notice.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
[90% of orders have been shipped](https://blog.flipperzero.one/most-kickstarter-orders-shipped/)  
So it depends on what country you're in and if you made sure they had the right information when they asked for it, at least a few times for me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
At the moment I'm in Italy so I'm Not so surprised about the delay tbh
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
No if you are in US it probably in customs it took me about 30 days for that step
-------------------------------

The problem also comes, that although it ignores these failures, the board does not make any light or create the "MarauderOTA" WIFI network. And I can't go on from there.

All the time the same. I have the port well chosen and all the values as they appear on the web and in the video, but I get that error all the time.

1 : 2022-07-20
As far as I know, no one has yet started working on it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Bit late in the game, but do you know someone in the community who started actually reading the data?  
As far as I know you need a key to decrypt the data which is actually the number on the ID page, at least for EU passports.  
I am thinking about an app which would download the fingerprints and the image to your SD card.

I am also interested in one and will keep watching your store. Please let us know when the protectors become available again :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Your right, but due to  international shipping rules everything other than paper has to be shipped as a package (can be in letter form tho). I can try sending them as letters, but theyll most likely end up getting destroyed or sent back (especially in the US). I mean I would love to give it a try because thats basically no cost but with a high risk of the buyer not receiving it at all.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Nice to see another black case. I was starting to think I had the only one
-------------------------------

Is this kit from Game of Bricks https://gameofbricks.eu/products/lego-daily-bugle-76178-light-kit

I bought the remote kit, definitely recommended. I currently have it running on battery but eventually it will run off the mains via micro USB.

There are no flippers in stock right now for the North American region (R02)

The problem is with the customer service. Ive already told him Ive gone to the post office twice. 

How is it flippers fault that usps failed to deliver it?

Its not their fault but its still their responsibility.  I paid for my product and havent received it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
the latest shop refresh didn't include the US unfortunately
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
idk I even tried an address in Dallas TX and it didn't let me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
yeah, honestly in your case I can see the flipper being a very useful tool. because those remotes are static and in a supported frequency, i really think it will be possible to clone them.

and if youre interested in things like rfid and nfc, keeping all of that in one place would be super convenient.

im not sure why it wont let you ship to LA, i got mine shipped to arizona with no problem.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Those little switches are dip switches they set the signal on older remotes before rolling codes; flipper can see the frequency so decent maybe but can't say for sure without knowing what systems exactly they are used on
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
yea I probably could but I also liked the RFID and remote functionality for this device cause it would be nice to also condense down key cards.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
i would venture to guess that yes, the flipper might be able to clone those remotes. 

however, you may be able to get a cheaper tool that would be able to receive and transmit subghz frequencies
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20

The point is that at the very back of the LCD, there's backlight that always lights the whole screen uniformly. Then that light is selectively blocked using liquid crystal array, creating pixels.

So this dark mode only blocks more light, by utilizing more pixels. In theory, it'd draw even more current as more crystal pixels are on overall.

It's worth noting though, that generally the LCD segments itself draw very little power. That's why they're commonly used in pocket calculators - often without the backlight at all, for example.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Same for me
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
Fair enough,  I have no idea how much an lcd draws either way.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
It's an LCD so I'd imagine it doesn't affect it at all, if we ignore absolutely miniscule differences that this could make.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-20
I'm looking forward to trying this.

If you can't get a flipper in your country. There's a high chance you won't get any other hardware similar or better. It's at a higher price, but still you won't be able to import illegal items regardless.

Maybe as someone suggested get it delivered to a friend in another country. Hopefully close by. And for for a holiday.....and on way back. Get a child to hold it for you making it look like a kids toy. Just an idea if you are going via plane.

The link above is from the recent one (Kevin), not the other thing a while back. It didn't contain a website at the time, but it also didn't contain a PoC :) I didn't look for anything not related to this CVE though.  


The RTL-SDR article comments go into a bit as to why people are saying this newest thing is cashing in on an older one despite there appearing to be some differences etc (I don't really care about the attribution of it more the PoC itself).

If you're not happy with that, its a pretty easy change. I'm pretty sure that you can't actually change the name (since it is the serial number essentially), but you can artificially change it `passport.c`

They all know about me having a key for every car and a master key. Small town ups stores dont really give a shir about anything. I have keys to their buildings all their cars and so on.

There's a CVE and the basics by the discoverer (Kevin) and a 2nd party has set it up (Rob Stumpf). Since then there appears to be a lot of videos of it working.   


Only reason I asked is several videos from people not related to the discoverer have it working using HackRF and wondered if anyone here had done it (or someone with a HackRF had converted it to flipper).

What app are you using to write? Are you writing directly to flipper, or to another tag and then reading that with the flipper?

Also, to my knowledge, mifare classic cards do nor support writing NDEF payloads to them (the links, wifi passwords, contacts etc)
You should probably try using an NTAG instead

Do you have security cameras where you are that have infrared lighting(night vision). Possible interference from that.

Infrared can bounce of certain hard objects especially something shiny or glass.

But surely the IR signals has to be within range of the flipper for it to detect them?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-19
That happened to me too. I was doing my tv remote(ir) was outside. And as I started it up came up with 88 or some ridiculous number of samples. 

I summed it up to interference from IR signals outside from sunlight in particular.

I believe this post to be OK because RM firmware is no longer unlocked out of the box, but I'm sure a mod will let me know if I'm wrong...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-19
Right now it's not as simple as copying files to the device. You have to flash the entire firmware. So maybe look around for some alternative firmware that includes the plugins you want. I believe we're not allowed to discuss that on this sub though.
-------------------------------

Still haven't tested it because I read someone else say theirs didn't

Yep, as someone else has already stated this is the unmodifiable name my device came with, I can just keep it like that :D.  

I know there should be ways to change it with custom firmwares and stuff but honestly I really like the serendipity, also makes every device really unique in more than just a serial number.

I've had problems emulating NFC as well - Amiibo on Switch, FYI.

The only solution I have is restarting Flipper until it picks on - it can happen on the first restart, or it can take a few. It also doesn't solve forever, every time I want to use NFC I have to restart.

Flash with official first this makes sure the databases and SD cards gat setup correctly then upgrade to either. Flashing with qFlipper is easy and it works for installing the alt firmwares. Unless I am mistaken Rogue Master is the Unleashed build + extra plugins/apps. (And unleashed is based on the official build with restrictions removed and updated with major fixes between official point releases plus a few other enhancements)

Ooooh. I didnt consider that second one. I never had a headset with NFC, so, the premise of saving it is was lost on me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
They were indeed shipped back to HK. The problem with that was they were already region bound to usa hence the limited quantity order in late may that came about
-------------------------------

Nfc bluetooth link sets the pair priority when turning the headphones on if i can capture and emulate what my phone does it might be handy.   
But its the only NFC tag i had on hand.

What do you mean, rejected by customs?  Would those not have been shipped back to HK?  I must have missed that part of the story.

1 : 2022-07-18
Question; what purpose would saving the UID of your headphones serve?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Not sure what the material is, but if it is low cost and with a cutter like yours low effort to produce. 
But you can look at sending them as letters, in Australia we pay $20 or so for sending the smallest thing, but if it's an envelope it's $2

I did this when selling pins and NFC cards on Etsy, I wouldn't do it with items I didn't want to have to replace (as there is no tracking or protection) but for low cost items, the cost of reshipping every 1/30 is less than $20 postage

&gt; Look up your garage door manufacturers specs and just create your own code.

I can't help you beyond this as I honestly don't know. Look up what kind of codes your garage door uses, you mentioned you're on Unleashed. Don't they have a big pile of example codes? Couldn't you just take a generic one and add it manually? Not sure myself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
What is the code and how do I find it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Look when I saw what happened I gunned it out of the parking lot fast I dont think anyone saw me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Add the code manually. Look up your garage door manufacturers specs and just create your own code. To program a new remote to a garage door usually involves physically pushing a button on the garage door motor that puts it into 'learning' mode, then you send the signal and it 'should' work. I haven't personally added a manual code for my garage door yet but I know it can be done.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
How do I add my flipper as a opener? Like have it listen in the sub-ghz that it uses then go through the normal process or is there a different way. I have the unleashed firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Oh , yeah, well, thank you for your efforts!

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Wait, so RougeMaster's firmware includes all the same unlocks as Unleashed? Is RougeMaster's firmware based on Unleashed? I couldn't find any information online to suggest such.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Try holding down both buttons when you connect to either computer or flipper. Release reset and then release boot.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
If you clone your existing garage door opener (default firmware won't do this btw) it will probably only work once and it will definitely cause the cloned opener to desync. That's the whole security point to rolling codes, when you send the code signal you are broadcasting the current code AND the next code. The openers don't 'talk' back and forth with the garage door, it's just one way, the garage door is just listening. Since you cloned the code, you have no idea what the rolling algorithm is, you can't generate the 'next' code. If the 'next' code is wrong, the garage door thinks its a different opener for a different door. If you add the flipper to your garage door like it's a brand new opener, it sets the rolling algorithm and you can use it just like you would your opener.

So I have yet to get a Micro SD card for mine yet. Ever since I updated the firmware, aside from watching TV, the only thing mine does is yell at me for not having a Micro SD lol.  


The main thing I use mine for currently is as a remote control replacement. I simply don't use the TV remote anymore. I just carry my mans around and use him as the remote. It works really well and isn't nearly as clunky as I originally thought it would be to navigate through menus on TV! Maybe you could try that!

I cant quite parse your question.  What is a Bluetooth remote but over USB?  And what does that to do with a computer not posting?


That said, you can use a Flipper remotely over Bluetooth with your portable device.  Leave the Flipper in your pocket, have it scan for HIDs, capture and replay with your mobile device, all very James Bond!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Sounds like it defeats the purpose of rolling code but idk never heard that.

All i know is that even Honda didnt make a safe system on their cars so might be possible idk

from what little I have read, many garage door openers use a fixed set of rolling codes, like 20 or so, and will often accept a window of 3 or 4 within that list, so realistically 5 or 6 clicks should open the door.

Tracking hasn't updated for me so I guess I get one from EU2  
Hopefully tracking get's updated soon when Customs Clearance is done.

can't wait for my flipper! I am so hyped!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
Something similar for me.  
Shipping is also to GER and from YunExpress. It was also electronically announced on the 29th of June and since then, nothing has changed in the Tracking.

I cannot see a country of origin so idk if it's coming from china or the NL.

I check the tracking every day to see if anything has changed.

Awesome flipper zero github has a nice comparison of every fork.

That's cool. I wanted to makes sure I wasn't duplicating someone else's work. I'll get my Arduino rig running and then look through the sourcecode and  libraries.

I cant think of any reason why you couldn't buy one on ebay.

1 : 2022-07-18
I dont think you can do that tho,
But theres another comment that explains how to learn a new remote to the garage door
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-18
The simplest option would just to buy it through a re-shipper. You pay someone else who is in a location that can purchase it to buy it for you. They receive it and ship it to you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Yeah it's hardly noticeable I can just feel it with my fingers. But the corner ones not bad either. Luck was on my side screen was good.

TLDR you can't build a flipper yourself
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
GitHub issues will be the best option.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
That's why I actually haven't ordered a case. I recall it was claimed that it's supposed to have somewhat rugged design, to withstand everyday wear and tear of just using it as a tool (not as a toy)

And I'm taking their word for it!

The only thing I would have ordered would have been the screen protectors as damage doesn't annoy me unless it doesn't impede the function of the device in any way.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Yes. There are still issues with creating a security + 2.0 and then learning it. There are more details on the official flipper forum. If you can help contribute some raw codes it could help the dev. https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/lift-master-security-2/3503

You and /u/lastminutelabor could likely find it under a different brand either on amazon or aliexpress.

&amp;#x200B;

It definitely looks like a product that is made OEM and shipped out of china under various brand names.

Maybe try keeloq ? That's how one of the rolling code algorithms ("technologies") is called.

1 : 2022-07-17
I tried this too with my newer 2014 infinity. After looking into it, it turns out it was a rolling signal or something like that. I also read that it could be that the signal changes all the time and that it is sent from the fob to the car then the car sends a signal back to the fob and then unlocks or something like that. Im not sure if this is what's happening to you're car but it didn't work ):

1 : 2022-07-17
So, I looked up the FCCID info for both my keys and poured through the data on them. I cannot see any direct language regarding whether or not it is or isnt a rolling code. Is there some kind of language/acronym I should be looking for that designates this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Cool
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Is there anything like this that is C to C, instead of C to A?

That's why "English" was in quotes....

At least it's rather pronounceable by an English speaking person.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Damn this looks p dope, thanks for the find!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Most models of cars do indeed use rolling codes. Some older models use static codes. 

Best way to get more information on how the key FOB works is to look up its FCC ID. It will tell you whether it's rolling, what frequency it transmits on, even a peak inside the device   in most cases.

You need to listen. What you are doing is WRONG. It is not going to get any less wrong if you silence me.  
Guns of Icarus players xedeon, HelFyre, FadedSilhoutte, Dementio, SlyCrossfox, Genesis and Kruegerz are bullies. The abuser Inkjet has not only been misusing the position as Muse community manager to protect those bullies but is actively helping them in attacking their victims. Muse Games head Howard Tsao (aka Bubbles) is aware of this abuse going on but has chosen to silence me instead of rooting out the abusers and bullies in Muse and the community. Now it is up to you to speak up.  
Bullies don't always realize the gravity of what they are doing. When you are however not only ignoring those that ask you to stop but take active steps to block them out there is no doubt that you are intentionally malicious. Stop this. Stop enabling bullies.  
Stop this insanity. Stop making excuses for abuse. Stop helping abusers hide their abuse. Stop helping bullies get away with bullying. Stop turning a blind eye when asked to stop this. Stop pretending that you can't do anything. Stop thinking this does not concern you. If you refuse to listen to victims because the truth is inconvenient then you too become party to the abuse. Stop this inhumanity.  
Let me remind you that you all have seen Genesis publicly bullied me in the GoI discord server via profile picture and status message yet have chosen to do nothing. To this day Genesis has seen no real consequences for that abuse and is still a Mod endorsed by Muse Games.  
You think if you just keep silencing me for long enough that this will all go away. This will never happen. You will not "win" this by force. There is nothing you can do TO me to make me let you get away with abusing me. The only way for this to stop is for you to stop being abusers and make amends for your misdeeds.  
I will not be abused no matter how big of a hammer you use to try to crush me.

Now Im genuinely interested. I started with a Field Detector as well as the Chameleon Tiny Pro and a Keysy. Back then I tried everything I found in the wild (mainly bus tickets and hotels) but have yet to find a single LF system. 

Im talking Italy, Germany, Austria, Estonia, Ireland. Where in Europe did you encounter LF?

Unfortunately back then I didnt really know much about RFID and the Chameleon alone is not quite enough. But now that Ive got the PM3 RDV4 I have to start travelling again.

Screen protector is anything thats plastic , not glass big enough to fit in a circut.   I used some extra Switch protectors I had laying around.   Gave me about 6 per sheet.

I live in Europe... I've needed to clone about 6 LF tags so far, in contrast, I encounter only 2 hf systems, both of which use desire (and one of them uses UIDs only for authentication lmao)


The LF systems here are mostly used to access the block of flats.

You're missing my point.  Sure: they may have no idea.  But if there's a scenario where the insurance assessor uncovers this then they'll void the claim.

I'm pointing out to OP that it \*\*could\*\* void a theft claim.  It may not, he/she may not give a shit or be fine with the risk.

I'm guessing I'm older than OP.  I spent my 20's modifying vehicles including building a remote unlock system not too dissimilar to this and have tales and scars with insurance claims and modified vehicles.
-------------------------------

It seems legitimately likely you are talking out your ass. He could have declared all this, and if he didnt know would they find out?

I live in Australia, where tow-truck thefts with GPS jammers happen \*\*all the time\*\* to 90's performance JDM vehicles.  It ain't just Porsches.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
The price point is going to get so many people into this too. I spent 100s probably just messing with WiFi and rfid cards without much success before flipper came along and it does its thing so well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-17
Every insurance company I'm aware of would 100% void a theft claim if you've screwed with the car's security/anti-theft systems.

I have no fucking idea who OP's insurer is though so I'd be talking out my ass making an absolute statement.

I've been using that frequency here in Australia. It was labelled EU on the hackrf portpack mayhem sample files with that frequency set. Just used notepad++ to edit the files that are available for flipper. Frequency set is towards the top of the file. I also use roguemaster firmware.
-------------------------------

I certainly agree with you, believe me. I was recently at my ophthalmologist and she used a stem cell lens to heal my cornea(didn't work and actually made it worse). Turns out one lens costs 1500 dollars. No one told me this and no one seemed to check how much I had to pay out of pocket.

I didn't realize that and it makes sense. Thanks.

The name is written to a read-only memory chip, but you can patch your firmware so it reads it from another location

Do you have a microSD card in the slot? You will need one to update the firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16
yeah not sure what to say, it doesn't.

Maybe my region's rfid cards are different, but nothing gets picked up in scans

The frequencies used are blocked by the flipper firmware. Youd need to use a unofficial one, like Rogue Master, to have a full frequency unlock

Their locked for local legal reasons. You should also know that if you go outside the frequencies supported by the chip you can damage it, I believe Tesla is a safe one thou
-------------------------------

there are legacy supported mifare classic cards that can indeed be cloned (value isnt stored so theres no point trying to edit the balance) 

these cards stopped being distributed in like 2018 so the only way to get them is to find old cards from friends or family or ebay but its a viable option. personally ive got a few
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16
Interesting. Thanks for the tip Ill give it a try
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16
Yeah about that... You can unwind a bit to get more wire. Besides that, I'd fix the wires and mainly the coil PCB mount points with some glue. If the wires are protected and antenna coil "module" is fixed on the PCB so that it's literally immovable, it simply can't break another time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16
Get this person a beer

It broke  someone kept taking it apart for whatever reason and the antenna wire is super tiny broke. I fixed it once but it broke again. Just havent ordered another one.

-------------------------------

Where is your keysy?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16
* Standing in the back: Proxmark3 RDV 4 w/ Blueshark
* White plastic: I believe this is a USB bluetooth classic adapter (based on the HC-06) for the Blueshark
* Orange/black: Flipper Zero w/ orange silicone case
* Far left: Chameleon Tiny (possibly Pro)
* Front: RFID field detector

As for what they do, that would be redundant to write up since you can google any of their names and find lots of descriptions.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-16

Honestly, skins in general for the flipper would be such a nice addition. Like the option to get some custom printed and cut to size. Sure there will be some cursed ones, but lots of good potential for current owners.

I've looked into this a bit more and the issue is the current firmware, ive seen on discord that the problem is known and a fix is on the way.

The port itself on my flipper seems solid and I can mostly cause the power stutter while holding the crimped region of wire in place and wiggling the port, so my bet is a bad crimp on the plug.

tried writing a script

same problem

ALTSTRING doesn't work in my case because once it has done WIN+R it just spams numbers into the run box

Does it power on?  
If you have a device (phone, etc) that supports usb serial you may try hitting the CLI and looking at the logs.  
If it powers on.
-------------------------------

Have you done this? 

https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/firmware-update/firmware-recovery

You could use powershell to change the pc's keyboard layout. However I feel this is an issue with the flipper firmware itself...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
It should be able to as it is
-------------------------------

1 : 2022-07-15
I am using the provided USB cable that came with the device. USB C on the Flipper and USB A on my PC
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
My favorite so far
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Are you connecting to your computer through usb-c? If so try normal USB
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
N1llel4, I like how it sounds like Nil if you've used Lua before.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Tried that. I can't find the device as I don't have anything under my device manager tab that says Universal Serial Bus Devices.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Yes, you can do this via qFlipper
-------------------------------

Can you try updating via the mobile app?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
If you have an android phone I know you can save it to your phone first through the flipper app then possibly send it to the other flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Pul0wl, took some getting used to but I know a few of my friends flippers had some dreadful names!

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
I didn't expect a reply lmao, sounds like you guys are on it! Thank you for the insight and yeah I totally missed the favorites menu in the first 24 hours with this thing, I want to clarify that I think you all are doing an amazing job.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Hmmm strange. Still... I wish there was an easier way of doing it than having to edit every line with a \\ in it.. would be great if there was a command to simply tell the script to use a US layout. Not seen an issue like this in any other language :/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15

ich hab am donnerstag bestellt
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Very true! I'm excited to see what people will do!
-------------------------------

Not really, but Un4ch0le's on level 2, and it is what it is on official FW. Don't really feel like messing with CFW
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Yes you are able to change the name. It is probably not to be discussed in here but look up rougemaster
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Same, thought by the date I got the shipping info (01.07.) mine will be in the first batch. But I think it might be the second batch.

I have a little hope as the last ali-order allso traveled through nl and the dhl tracking was not correct (got the package and tracking said it is still on the way)

I ordered something on aliexpress on 08.07. will see if it will arrive earlier, is already on the plane to germany :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Looks fantastic! I've done exactly what you did but with black :) Thanks for the awesome blog, very thorough!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Can you?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
The flippers can't communicate directly yet. You need to get data off the SD card to a PC or the mobile app first, then share from there.

You could technically write from one flipper to another by emulating whatever you've captured, then capturing that again on another flipper, but that's more a happy side-effect than a feature.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
In what world do you live in? I do not think I have heard on many GTAs involving a tow truck driver armed with a GPS jammer. 

They drive some souped-up Honda not a Porsche.

Let them have their fun!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Absolutely. All smart cards are sub gig hz. I'm sure a device like that could be built. It might even be able to do that with the flipper hardware. Are you suggesting it as a mod to the firmware? 

We would first need to mod the firmware to expand the group of frequencies that it scans. Then add a new feature called something like "Device Found" which would scan through the group of frequencies and just look for a ping-back without attempting to read the data. Does that sound about right. This sounds like a fun project. I too have been frustrated by valid cards that are simply not being picked up by the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Did you see the tracking status change?  Mine is still on the road from Vegas.  Its been that way for five days and I am a little antsy.  Im PNW.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Mine is inch4. Really thinking about changing it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
This is very unfortunate lol

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
To detect the card protocol, you have to write a parser. If you have a parser, you can not only detect the card, but also read it. So, the problem is that you need to support the card in order to show that it's not supported. Even just detecting any card requires the flipper to at least demodulate the signal to tell it apart from random noise (and even then, there'll be false positives)

And with subghz protocols - there's too much noise to be able to reliably tell you that your signal is not supported. There'll be too much false negatives (when a supported signal is shown as unsupported, for example, if the flipper didn't catch the whole signal but just a part of it), and false positives (when random noise which isn't a signal is shown as an unsupported signal)

There are tons of daily uses for it, even if you just copy your remote controls
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Yeah, aftermarket remote start is super insecure. No encryption whatsoever it seems
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
once the GUI aspect has been completed and tested to make sure it runs smoothly on the flip ill be submitting it everywhere i can :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
of course.  but i'm talking, for example, smart-cards which are, afaik, mostly sub-ghz at most.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Would you be so kind to submit it to core flipper API or to Unleashed?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
and the rest.   " comes out as @ etc (despite the script saying " )  so
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
There's lots of action at 2.4 GHz. Flipper doesn't go over 1GHz. If I have something that isn't being read I first try to identify the operating frequency. If you don't know anything about an object then you're mostly SOL if it's not being read. The device could simply be outside the parameters of what Flipper can see.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Poor upset Flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
so is that a good thing or a bad thing?   is that the fix?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Hmm, I did wonder why most of the badusb scripts i've tried just flat out don't work :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
I will try this with my case too when my flipper finally arrives.  
I am hoping for a color like this.  
Black would be nice too but Military Green would look best on a black Flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Well you could at least talk to it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
arrive bit later? do you think it will be deliverd in a week? or..?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Pin ;)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
If i figure something out I will let you know 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Herd it could be used in a lot of LA parking garages
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Maybe try wrapping it op?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
No I just got a notification from DHL 10 minutes ago. I'm just an inpatient ass.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
You're probably in the second batch like me. Updating the tracking link every hour 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Patience is a virtue
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
For me it has been released yesterday.
Arrived in NL on the 15.06
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Ahhh okay thanks :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Yeah yeah
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Hope you get your flipper soon! And that my parcel arrives in NL next :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Ah ok that makes sense. Then i hope my package arrives soon in NL as well.

Thanks for the reply!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Just wait.. it will come
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Thanks for the heads up! I'll be extra careful!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Not to rain on what you've done, but you've legitimately likely voided insurance too if you have a theft and the insurance company get any wind of this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
Exactly the same status for me. If the package has a starting date of the tracking number as the 29th of June, it will probably be the second EU batch and arrive a bit later.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
I am from Germany too.
I got my heads-up (electronical registered) on the 15.06.

And Yesterday!!! I got the info it's released from customs and shall receive an update in the tracking at dhl in of 24hrs.... Waaaaiting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
It didn't come from NL, it was shipped from HK to NL. It arrived in NL a few days ago and has cleared customs. 

The tracking link will update once the last mile delivery company has the package.

However they should already have the package but my tracking link (Belgium) is also still showing nothing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15
About 33 days
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-15

I'll have to hop on that :) sounds fun! I would love to say I helped make some utilitarian design choices with the talented people here for this awesome toy. 

I'm also surprised the community liked my tipsy rambling, I am sure the devs are more concerned with making sure everything just works and my suggestions are just for saving a minute here and there for quality of life.

But using this thing on the fly day to day truly feels like I'm memorizing menus to speedrun a game lol, maybe there's something to that that can make it more fun to "speedrun". Ergonomically considered menus that make you look cool for memorizing the path to whatever you need? Who knows lol

You should use a protoboard to use a robotic arm to move that polarizer for you. Like a Monocle.

Thank you for the heads up!

I did contemplate this but, my previous anti-theft should help; removable steering wheel, two more kill switches, two different gps tracking devices.

I'm planning on installing a camera that will allow me to see inside the car whenever I want. That coupled with a notification sent to me when the car is started will help.

Probably even find a way to play all speakers full blast screaming "this car is stolen call 911" lol. I'll have to learn most of this, but it shouldn't be impossible.

Ohhh, that's gonna be a long one&gt; Creation of a folder for plugins called applications where the user can drag and drop files into the SD card would be great because I have no idea how to make flappy bird work. Maybe make the bit of firmware needed to make it work, easier to implement.\* That reaquiers A LOT of work, but we're working on it (for the context, we've already spent more than 4 months working on this)

\&gt; Allow users to re-order the main functions (subghz, infrared, etc) OR just test and survey for the two most popular functions (which would just be more UX research heavy)\* Yep, already done that, and that's the order we settled on

\&gt; Allow tags/ some kind of delineation in BadUSB for the top 2/3 most common OSes\* BadUSB scripts are OS- and System-agnostic, but if you want you can either just create separate folders for separate OSes or just add some indication to the filename. Adding separate indicators would be unnecesary and only confuse users for the scripts that work for multiple platforms

\&gt; Customizable functionality of shortcut buttons after wake, there are 6 buttons you can press after wake, but many don't appeal to all users.\* The settings menu for that sounds like a UX hell, as we're trying to avoid menus like that at all costs. There's already two favorite apps you can set, and the only app that is not only reachable from the desktop but from some other menu is Passport. Others are only reachable via the desktop, and that's intended.

\&gt; Make Dumb Mode play a Specific Plugin like Snake Game\* We have interesting plans for it, but it's not ready yet.&gt; Clarify what levels do and what data the flipper has collected. (also clarify why their level is meaningful functionally?)\* I'm honestly not sure how you can do that on our tiny screen without excessive dialogues (which are hard to implement and take up extra space in the internal memory), but we'll have a documentation page for that

\&gt; Option to make a saved IR Remote look like the Universal Remote UI (bonus points if it can be re-adjusted to other common use cases like LED bulb remotes.) (I would make this implementable by an external app, not natively pressing through that keyboard)\* Already working on it

\&gt; A Favorites Menu that only holds the users determined favorites no matter what frequency and type they are on (which would bypass the need to customize shortcuts after wake)\* This already exists. Press down on the desktop, choose any file and choose "Pin". Now you have a "Favorites" tab in your Archive that stores all pinned keys, no matter the type.

\&gt; Personally, I want to check all types of frequencies at the same time, instead of googling the type for whatever Im holding onto. Maybe specifically, sub GHz would need an extra prompt for this kind of tool that suggests that the frequency they are looking for would need some parsing of some settings but does this hardware allow it?\* Sounds like you're talking about a frequency analyzer, which is a feature that already exists.

\&gt; Ive noticed that in many cases the menu would benefit from having two vertical columns instead of one. We have a horizontally biased screen, some button presses could be saved there.\* This would make the small amount of text we can use for a menu section even smaller, isn't worth it.

\&gt;  I can only get between my \*\*saved\*\* functions by multiple presses of the same button. (after wake, down, and then left or right), yet there are 6 accessible buttons after the wake screen. You could display level after unlock instead of sacrificing the right arrow key input, and just have it disappear in a timely manner, it would save you a button to make things more useful to users.\* Again, the Favorites menu mostly solves that

\&gt; The 9 main functions are not alphabetical so was there testing on what would be most popular?\* Yes

\&gt; No integrated Lock Button relies on muscle memory (press up and then ok, or spam the undo button until the home screen before you rely on muscle memory) I would love a dedicated button\* We'd love it too, but we've realised this too late in the hardware development process.

\&gt; buttons feel like Ill break them eventually\* Trust me, you won't. They're basically indestructible.

\&gt; white body feels very easy to chip and stain in a pocket for a 170-dollar device\* You can get a case. Mine didn't after more than 7 months of daily carrying in a pocket, though.

Or your carrier.  I get it.  Nothing personal.

It ships (to USPS) when the truck to xxx gets full.  My truck is slow to fill.  Im nowhere.  It makes sense.


-------------------------------

Probably mid to late august along with the next batch of flippers

I used the following item for a self wired remote start. I had to use a step up relay since ignition and starter power is pretty high.

I then tested it with the original remotes to ensure it worked, then I copied the signal using Flipper Zero.

Wiring up your own remote start on a manual transmission can be dangerous, because you can by pass safety switches. Please be careful when wiring up so you cannot start up your car in gear.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I believe you can use a command for alt codes instead to allow for international keyboards
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Yeah, I had the same issue with that firmware. I have no idea then.
-------------------------------

No, is that a firmware? I'm just running stock.

Tried it on the UberGuidoZ Char\_Test by changing:

`STRING \ Backslash` 

to:

`ALTSTRING \ Backslash`

and it just printed:

`923266979910711510897115104`
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Why they are not updating the shipping page with such information?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Try changing STRING into ALTSTRING in the script.

backing flipper zero in kickstarter was basically a kick intoi the nuts tbh

they delivered more units to lab401 then to aftual kickstarter backers who made the flipper possible lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
i did both lol  
i had a pi zero w laying around.  


pi's are like impossible to get at a reasonable price atm
-------------------------------

 bro i paid 50 bucks for shipping and now i ordered a flipper in white (my rewqard is a black flipper) because 3rd party will deliver it faster than flipper company lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
ouch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Thats not bad. Good luck.

Maybe specifically, sub GHz would need an extra prompt for this kind of tool that suggests that the frequency they are looking for would need some parsing of some settings but does this hardware allow it?

This would be great. I think the only downside would be that you could pick up signals from devices you aren't interested in. That'd also make it more fun to explore with, though.

On a related note, I'm also still having trouble with sub GHZ sensitivity. I've tried using the various release channels, doing a factory reset, etc. and still cannot read devices with any amount of consistency. For example, I've been able to read my car's keyfob ~5/500+. Are others having this issue? Have you somehow solved it?

Yep WiFi boars silicon case and screen protector came in right under $80 shipped
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Yeah just ordered mine think it said it would ship in a month or two
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Yeah I have a printer as well. I just might print the pelican case that you see in some of the GitHubs
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
There are some here - https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero

What did you use for the soap to break surface tension? 

My goto is Dawn, but I'm concerned since it's also a de-greaser it might interfere with dying process.
-------------------------------

I will be providing you with many additional resources. I am currently going through the source code to try and find the bug myself. I've figured out why the Flipper can only read the first two byte-group sectors. I can forward the relevant excerpts from the product datasheets. In the meantime I can send you multiple resources such as flipper screen captures, logs, and PCAP files. Should I post them to the main forum or is there a more efficient manner of getting these files sent to you?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Not saying monetize it. But a store format can be really useful for finding great content and making it easy to load and use.

To add on this, see if you (op) can get a make/model/brand of device, then look up the FCC registration and get the frequency it uses.

Fellow UX Designer here! My initial thoughts:

1. Mental model: Create task-specific menu flows rather than tech-specific flows.
2. Engagement and learning: Dolphin should ask you to do things for it as a type of tutorial and to up the fun-factor. 
3. Growth: Integrated marketplace (app store.)

What's your name in the discord? Gotta get you on my friends list
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Thats strange if GUI isnt to their taste dont use it lol, there are different schools of thought but no need to call anyone dumb whos actually finishing projects. 

I appreciate you too, Ill probably see you on the discord but I go by a diff name :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Just get the screen protector and the case to make it feel better lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I have my flipper but didn't order the case...now I was looking to order the case but can't justify dropping like $40 on a silicone case from the shipping :/ and waiting like a month. Should be fine, i'm pretty careful with my electronics.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I appreciate you. It's kinda cool getting to design the art I use for my GUI apps but at the same time I've had some people mercilessly attack me saying it's over the top and I'm dumb. I'm narsacistic for self promoting my own work even though it's completely open source and I don't license it so anyone can use it. Some of reddit is wholesome so ugh isn't
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Haha yeah I saw your drawings theyre pretty rad :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Naw ha I do graphic design as well so any chance I get to go over the top with that I do
-------------------------------

So I'm based out of the US, I work 10-6 but it's a bonus job just for the experience. I get full disability from the military so I don't technically have to work. So I definitely have the time to commit to it. Just need to define my path.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
What country are you based in? 
Im guessing youre not too old either so getting corp experience will always be useful for later tutor SME type roles. If you have a job that doesnt eat into your free time and you dont get burned out you can do both. I work 9-5 5 days a week so could do some stuff
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Ideally both. 
I just got a job offer of sorts to do red team work with a bank and a cybersecurity firm. My good buddy is the CFO of the firm so I'm thinking there, but I also really want to continue providing public information on a bigger scale so yeaaaa 

But either honestly would be a dream come true
-------------------------------

If they conform to the naming standards, you can add to the stock f/w by creating a directory in the applications directory with the appropriate name, and modifying applications.c to add the plugin to the menu.

Full details here: https://github.com/DroomOne/Flipper-Plugin-Tutorial
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Didn't order it myself either, to my regret. Now, with shipping &amp; tax it comes in at nearly $80

Gonna be DIYing this one, I think

Ah cool, you looking to go career with a company as a pen tester or similar or more of a Wes Bos or Troy Hunt kinda guy?
-------------------------------

Not in an official capacity but it's something I have been doing for a long time yes. Mostly self taught, wasn't until a few years ago I decided to try and get certifications and pursue an actual career.

1 : 2022-07-14
Ive seen you all over on the flipper stuff have you been on security for awhile?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I was sitting in my living room the other day and was struggling to get it to do what I want (my remotes are hard to find, and when I find them, there's like a 50/50 chance they'll have batteries... Kids...)

Then I realized I could try the flipper. 

Finding my tv's remote in the IRDB got me way too excited. I get my own personal TV remote :')
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I had the same issue. The only way I got through was by restarting the Flipper - and sometimes I had to restart a bunch before getting it to transmit.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Yeah I asked if they could and they said no. But in the end of the day its 18 bucks. Im not gonna lose any sleep over it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
The desync happens when it Succeeds

The code expected by the receiver changes

Problem is the flipper can't generate that code, so if we can successfully emulate the signal once, Great! but we can't edit the signal to create the next code. That's the rub.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Well, just in case he comes here, let's just go ahead and tell him How to fix it:

Press a single button over and over until it works.

There, now the secret is out.  lets hope it makes it to him
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I dont, because it would just move the discussion elsewhere and break up the community effort. Bud consistency is more logical.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Cool. It sounds like you want them to take a heavier hand in moderation of discord too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Yes but the reason this is silly is because their official discord allows this discussion so there is no parity between the two
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
False alarm.
It was my browser configuration. I reached the site and successfully downloaded the installer package. Confirmed working in 2 other browsers and by another user.
-------------------------------

reminder the port closes automatically after like 4 seconds
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
Also, qFlipper have console version. You can find it in qFlipper installation folder.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
You can do it with flipper directly, no apps needed. All previously installed version are in /ext/updates folder
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
&gt; Seems the qFlipper download page for Windows OS is returning a 404. Possibly crashing from too much traffic with this last shipment of devices? Down for maintenance? Anybody else getting this?


Can you show me exact link where you have this issue?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
We are working on NFC app redesign. It includes better work with keys.
Do you have proxmark? Is it reading your cards?

1 : 2022-07-14
It does, if you don't take into account the risks. A ban in the US would basically kill the company. 
Nobody is saying you can't do certain thing,  FZ are just being cautious that such things aren't discussed in a forum than could be considered "theirs" and as such considered official information.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
bruh what? the shipping cost as much as  the case, what was the point.

too bad they couldnt just add it to your original order like a decent seller
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
It seems silly tho
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
they're just policing what happens in their subreddit, which is totally fine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
These bands fall under what is known as ISM bands. These are frequency ranges for which no license is required to transmit. ISM stands for Industrial, Scientific and Medical, which gives an indication of what sort of traffic you can expect.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-14
I'll also add that a major pain point is likely to be how many times you have to press the buttons to get to what you want. I've personally been thinking of a few solutions, it would be fun to render them in blender or something, I'll do that later.

Hi just curious about how likely this is? Wikipedia says that typically rolling codes check for around \~256 codes in the sequence (because a missed transmission is quite common in the real world), I guess if he was really sitting there pressing it?

1 : 2022-07-13
Shhhh.  Im in the same boat. The Flipper folks dont have anything to do with it at this point.  They shipped, the product is on the road.

They likely shipped to various USPS distro sites.  These are a day or two away from you, depending.  I expect the tracking will update the same day or one day before delivery.

My buddy in the Midwest got his, same shipment.  Its close, friend.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Don't lol One guy posted in the fb book a link for custom made shields with 2 day shipping. Only reason I'm considering them is because I can justify buying the wifi devboard but now I'm thinking why the heck do I want this? Its basically the same price to build a pwnagotchi
-------------------------------

Reach out to USPS if you have that confirmation, youre at least able to prove its within the USPS system from what youre seeing.

They should be able to sort that out and get it to you.

If it were like mine, just stuck with no one saying they have it youd be a bit more SOL.

Give it a shot.

Ahh I see. Well my Flipper says it has arrived at a local USPS. Just hasnt moved since then.

I am in the same exact boat. It hasnt moved at all since the 9th, and its literally in the major city near me.

So my accessories package and flipper were both updating and moving along through shipping together, Saturday they both showed the same left shipper facility status.

Tracking updated for the accessories package across Saturday, Sunday, and arrived with me on Monday.

The Flipper tracking number hasnt shown a single move after departed shipper facility on Saturday, and not a single thing on USPS end.

Heard back from USPS, mine never actually hit USPS so its still with OSM Wolrdwide, or has been taken during shipping.

They actually suggested I have Flipper send another I wish it were that simple considering the process and time these take to just get in country.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Well it still sucks but at least I am not alone. Hopefully they get this shit figured out.
-------------------------------

It can be a physical 2FA key and can execute keyboard scripts. Of course, you can also execute scripts in any programming language of your choosing on the computer instead but Flipper makes them portable.

What about a relay attack utilizing two flippers?

Yes, that's precisely why I have been suggesting op to utilize the tab autocompletion in my thread.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
&gt;I get that you're trying to help, but you're solving the wrong problem

I don't think I am. I am making sure it has exec permissions as well as that op is typing in at least the chmod command with correct syntax in the correct directory so to I know if to tell op to cd into other directory or troubleshoot something else.

Oh, you had x86\_**84** in your command instead of x86\_**64**  


`./qFlipper-x86_64-1.1.0.AppImage rules install` should be correct
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
The appimage is already executable, as the screenshot literally shows it running. The problem is the syntax of the console command.   


I get that you're trying to help, but you're solving the wrong problem
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
bash: ./qFlipper-x86\_84-1.1.0.AppImage: No such file or directory
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Oh, try putting ./ Before it. Like this:


&gt; ./qflipp...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Is really strange - I know its in there i can see it when I LS, but its telling me its not there.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Thats saying: bash: ./qFlipper-x86\_84-1.1.0.AppImage: No such file or directory
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
You followed astrrra's comment about adding ./?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
&gt;https://imgur.com/a/YocGLEG

Remove the quotes. The command should be `./qFlipper-x86_84-1.1.0.AppImage rules install`
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
I see...


Try this:


&gt; sudo qFlipper-x86_84-1.1.0.AppImage rules install


If it still doesn't work, try:

&gt; sudo chmod +x qFlipper-x86_84-1.1.0.AppImage

And then try the one above it.


Lastly, in the terminal, you should make sure you're in the same folder as where the qflipper....appimage file is.

You're currently on the desktop, but it might be in your "Downloads" folder. Just heads up.


Also, I recommend you using TAB autocompletion when typing filenames, just in case (type only a few letters "qflip" press TAB key, it should autocomplete. If it doesn't, press TAB once more and it should show you either options or it can't autocomplete it (BCS the file isn't there for example)


Hope I didn't confuse you more...

Im in the same boat, got my flipper and then ordered the case, Wi-Fi Dev. Board, and Proto Boards separately.

The flipper left shipping facility on Saturday with no scan or update since.

Filed a ticket with USPS, emailed OSM Worldwide (the third party shipper) who said to email flipper support.

Emailed flipper support with no reply at all as of today.

Seems like they all fell off a truck somewhere, or theres a very weird shipping thing going on

The upgrade path from 20.04 to 22.04 does not open until after  the release of Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS which is still \~three months into the future.   It's the same as prior LTS releases &amp; upgrades (and exactly as documentation states).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Your operating system is out of date. Still supported, but you should upgrade to at least Ubuntu 22.04LTS.

The error message is difficult to follow but it looks like permission was denied, as your user doesn't have access to the serial port on your computer. You should ensure the Zero isn't connected via a Bluetooth or existing wire connection, grant your user access to the serial port on your computer (run "qFlipper-x86_84-{version}.AppImage rules install" to do so automatically), and reconnect your Flipper.

Wonderful. This is fantastic and it's getting me more and more excited to get my hands on it and learn! So all this is totally safe to use on my own computer? No nasties?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
No question is stupid if you are genuinely trying to learn. Don't feel bad about trying to learn. 
With that being said the flipper when using it on your pc just pretend to be a keyboard that types out something you have prepared really fast. So there are a million things it can do. 
Some payloads will just change your desktop wallpaper and some will steal your wifi password 
It all just really depends on what the specific payload is 

This repository below is one I made to teach new people the things they can do with it. There are 21 different functions with written and video tutorials. This can be a good place to start

Thanks for this information. I'm really learning a lot just by this lil convo we're having. And to ask a real stupid question, if I was to do this to my own laptop, how do I safely get my laptop back to normal? Like there won't be any damage to my laptop will there?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
No worries everyone starts somewhere. 
Yes it has to be plugged into someone's computer 

So pretty much hiding it would be not letting them see you plug it in 

Some people have recently found a way to connect a nrfl01 chip to the flipper which allows you to control SOME Bluetooth keyboards. 

But the flipper wasn't really made to be stealthy it is learning device more than anything. If you want to do this in a stealthy manner at some point hak5 sells the omg cable. It's a phone charging cable that let's you do hid attacks like the flipper but it's designed to be stealthy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Thank you very much for the reply. I do have a question though (and please bare with me as I'm learning as I go)

If I want to do this to someone's computer, I have to connect the flipper to their computer, correct? Or is there a way to do it without them knowing? 

Thanks in advance!

Generally, if it supports above 32gb (supports sdxc) it should support up to 2tb. 
I've only run into a couple devices that wouldn't work with higher sized cards (like a dashcam that topped out at non standard amount like 127gb) and that's cause of shitty firmware on the device (seemed like it used a signed 8bit storage somewhere in it's handling of the sd card) more than any sort of slot limitation or specification limitation.

We were only licensed to use specific frequencies in specific regions
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
If it appears that they are triggered from a central location over RF then you just need to determine what frequency they are on then be ready to record when they trigger it. It would be easiest to record if you knew when they tested it so you could be around to capture the signal rather than having to wait on lightning to trigger the signal.

Nope, didn't fix my problems. Same two bugs for me. Problems reading Mifare Classic chips.

1.) Have hotel card. Flipper identifies it as Mifare Classic. Then I run the Read Mifare Classic app. It picks up two keys. 1/16 for sector A and another, 1/16 in sector B. It says 2/32 keys found but then the system stops. It doesn't crash it just can't find the remaining keys and I'm unable to move forward to seeing and saving any of the keys.

2.) I built a card using an old MIFARE Classic EV1 SL1MOA2S30 chip. I've tried different winding counts and re-soldered two different chips already. It still won't pick it up and I don't think it's my wiring or my build process. I built two other cards. A Mifare DES and a Mifare Ultralight. They both worked perfectly. I don't know if I should try it again using another chip and different windings count.

If you are interested in learning, I would just go clone the official repo, make zero changes and just compile it to understand how it works.  


Steps are documented in full here: [https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware) 

But its just:  
`$ git clone --recursive` [`https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git)  
`$ cd flipperzero-firmware`  
`$ docker-compose up -d`  
`$ docker-compose exec dev ./fbt`

Check dist/ for build outputs.

Then flash that .dfu file via qflipper

Once you do that, then go search the code (in the `flipperzero-firmware` dir) for a word that you see in the menu on the device "NFC" for example.  


Change that to "HACKED - NFC", save it and then just recompile it with:

`$ docker-compose up -d`  
`$ docker-compose exec dev ./fbt`

And flash that new file to your device and marvel in your custom GUI.

Start there and before you know youll have hacked all the things.

I'm using the Flipper as a learning device rather than a "hacking" device. First project is IR TV remote stuff. I want to use a smart switch to turn my TV on/off. So the Flipper was used to capture the power button signal from my remote. I'll next manually convert the IR capture file to a code I can program into the TV-B-Gone firmware (and delete the unused ones). Next I'll try out some RF stuff. I'd really like to learn about wireless protocols by reverse engineering some kind of basic device.

In high school I bought a 256 MB (not GB) USB flash drive for around $200. Compared to 1.44MB floppies that were common just a few year prior, it was massive. Compared to 700MB CDs which were the most common medium of the time, it was extremely fast.

The other day I paid $8 for a 32GB card to go in the flipper. Crazy times.

Whoops my bad - I have deleted the original post and include an edited version below:

You can't add plugins to the Flipper by dragging them onto the SD card yet as the plugin framework is still under development. 

If you want to add code you find on github you need to first download the Flipper firmware source (official or a fork) then add your code to the 'applications' folder and compile the FW using the Flipper build tool (which should be included with the source, but you will need to have docker installed in order to run it) 

If it compiles successfully you will get a  .dfu file - this is the FW including your github code. You load this onto your Flipper using the qFlipper application on ur computer (I think u can do it via Android as well after you've first updated the factory firmware using ur computer).

If that's too much right now you can just grab a precompiled FW that should include most of the tools/demos floating around on github

Mine seems to be working fine with a 128gb. Its a Samsung evo card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
I thought it could take UP to 64 GB on the micro?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
What do you ask?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
What?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
I have a 64gb card in mine and I feel that even that will be more than enough for the lifetime of myself and the dolphin.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
128gb is definitely overkill

You need to at lease attach the full log file, not just copy-pase. Also, what's your OS? If you're on Linux, did you set up udev rules? Are you using any USB hubs or adapters?

Yep. Same for me. Im expecting an update today or tomorrow
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
To give you an idea of what might be possible... I am planning a device that spoofs barcodes by flickering an LED. Also, since the GPIO includes RS232, I am looking at writing a uboot hacker tool. Uboot is the boot manager often used by embedded devices like IOT things, routers etc, and getting access to the uboot commandline is step 0 in hacking them.  
Also, some sort of portable protocol analyser would be... a device that can sniff i2c, SPI and serial bus and capture the data for analysis.

It explains the . Files. iOS does it every time it writes files, usually like in Windows, they would be hidden. When that happens, I usually use my file explorer to eliminate them before ejecting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
The plugin has to be coded into the firmware and compiled.  Once finished, in qFlipper select "Install from file" and use the .dfu.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
That's Mac for ya!

Also delete your `.DS_Store` files.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
Thank u Ill research
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-13
you need to compile it yourself and include the plug-in during the compilation
-------------------------------

Snake is in the plugins folder
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Yup. A Mac feature since way back when. Every indexed file gets a sidecar "dotfile" that holds the indexing metadata.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Are you using a Macbook? Usually it adds those files when writing them on the sd card.

 It a dumb question! :-)

Repo = Repository. On GitHub you can have different repos which are collections of stuff (code, files, etc.) that allow you to keep things separate. Others can fork your repo (make a linked copy of it they can control and edit) to do their own thing or contribute! If you have a fork of a repo and make changes, you can open a pull request (PR) to the parent repo and they have the option to merge those changes (in whole, in part, or not at all) with what they were doing. And thats one of the way the open source stuff works. 

You can also have multiple people maintain a repo, such as the IRDB. I have a fork that is linked to the parent repo that I am also a maintainer (can control PRs or make changes directly) along with a number of others. 

[Check it out!](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB) You can see the parent repo name in the link on the top left, just below my repo name.

Read counters (emulation and reading from original tag) and locked page checking is also already implemented.  The PR was called NTAG21x complete emulation for a reason.

I'm still waiting for OP to send some more info. Someone else on Discord also mentioned having troubles, but trying to figure out whether it's specifically MFUL family or their NFC emulation not working in general.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Some games are actually trying to write/check counters. pcap file may answer this question. Anyway, please report issues on GitHub if you think that your case is different and attach logs and debug pcap.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Emulation doesn't really have much to do with that issue since the issue's for reading, and Amiibos aren't read-protected, just write-protected. The default PACK Flipper emits when the original PWD/PACK isn't known is the default one for Amiibos (contrary to the default on a blank tag, but I didn't change that since a lot of people end up using Flipper for Amiibos and their .nfc files don't contain the correct PWD/PACK), and any password is accepted, so that works out of the box already. Everything should be working already and was validated, so at this point we need to know whether there's something odd with OP's .nfc. Sounded like the original scan worked, so maybe some modification to the data occurred.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Yep scripts folder contains cli tools to do that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12

On UNIX-like systems files prefixed with a full stop (colloquially, "dotfiles") will be hidden by default by commands such as ls(1) and sometimes by graphical file managers. It's possible the hidden files were left there by your text editor (ed(1) leaves an "ed.hup" in the directory when it's closed improperly, maybe whatever text editor you're using does something similar?) or by the Flipper's system. You can remove them with rm(1) or with your graphical file manager's file removal function if it has one.

I did this earlier today. Unplugging and plugging it back into the USB didn't fix. But a restart did. Holding left arrow and back together a few seconds. It immediately connected for me after restart.

dumb question but what is a repo?

My apologies I did not see that before. We must have posted at the exact same time. That information is useful. I would still recommend trying another USB serial port.
-------------------------------

[This](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper) what you sent up a page shows the guys full flipper mods library, any more like this with lots of stuff to explore??
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Is the log data useless then?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Definitely need more context.

But I would recommend if you are trying to plug your flipper into your computer and use qflipper to try another USB port.

More details next time, such as a screenshot. That will help people help you..

Hi!  Welcome to the club.  I would recommend you begin with the stock firmware and decide later if you want to try something else.  You can find a lot of utility in just copying the signals from your remote controls, scanning a copy of your bus pass or remote entry key at work, etc.  And of course, spend a little time playing Snake.

I was just reading the TT manual earlier to see what I could do with the cloned remote. Press P1 and, if you're lucky, the box will have promotional credits available you could use. You could get a free song(s). If the volume is too high you could turn it down. If you want to be evil you can also skip songs or even flush the whole song queue but you'd be taking a song someone paid for.

Hey! Thank you for this! But I've not had any luck with getting the Amiibos from this repo working. The first time I scanned one, it worked, but after that, the Switch gives an error stating that "This is not an Amiibo". 

I've got several physical amiibos, and those work, as well as emulating those via Ultralight on the Flipper. Is there something I'm missing with that? The Readme doesn't mention any caveats. =

/u/scrushly, I have found an error in your post:

 &gt; ** / So ~~its~~ [**it's**] about a month

I believe that you, scrushly, have malformed a post and ought to have posted ** / So ~~its~~ [**it's**] about a month instead. Its is possessive; it's means it is or it has.

I was reading about an attack called rolling-pwn used to unlock and start Hondas. I'm not sure it can be implemented with the flipper. Plan on researching further tomorrow.
-------------------------------

Use it illegally? I wouldnt dare 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Only one way to find out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
There are f/w that ignore region information. It is your responsibility to not use the device illegally.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Unlikely, it's basically a denial of service attack.
-------------------------------

Can this be ran with stock firmware?
-------------------------------

Probably since we have different radio spectrum rules here.

There's a user in discord with just this issue.
Fixing it could cost a couple hundo depending on what car you're fucking with.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Im assuming the EU flippers and the UK flippers are the same yeah?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
I assumed that the superchargers just spat out a frequency and the Tesla opened the port when it heard it so all you had to do is copy the frequency
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Update to latest firmware with qFlipper. That's important, you'll get more features and stablility plus OTA support from mobile app and web.

Then it's ready to help you hack the world. Or at least everything not-so-protected in your neighborhood
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Is this an actual thing you can do?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Hey, can I have your spare? =D I'll even come to pick it up...

But seriously, as was said, this works on UHF and only an SDR will fulfill your desire to explore. The toggle, from my understanding, allows you to swap as some spots allow you to use the HOV lane as a toll lane when you're not an HOV, but it's monitored via camera. Swapping that allows you to not "pay" when you're actually HOV.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
Amazing!!! Thank you so much!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-12
It depends greatly on the car and age of said car most modern cars use rolling codes so the signal transmitted by the fob is different every time. On my old Toyota Camry with aftermarket keyfob it works and the signal transmitted is the same every time on my Haval H6 the signal that I read each time from the keyfob is different.

doesnt flipper use SPI mode anyways? This will [limit the speed](https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/sd-card-speed-using-spi) either way.

thats ver relevant though, because no-name cards apparently often dont properly support SPI mode anymore.

It's a simple dictionary attack. If the key's not in the dictionary, Flipper won't be able to get the sector. There's not enough computing power to perform MFOC on the device. If it doesn't get the keys consistently, it's more or less a timing issue, since all of the authentication have to be done through software because the NFC radio does not have built in hardware CRYPTO1.
-------------------------------

Hi, NTAG215 emulation is my implementation. Would you mind DMing me your Amiibo .nfc file so I can check if there's anything unusual?

The files/sub folders themselves; go into the file and that's where you'd drag and drop those sub folders into your main folder.. Like moving the fun_files folder into your NFC folder

okay, stand by please. i really appreciate your help
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
You'd unzip the file, and the next page down shows the files as they would be sorted on your sd card, NFC files into your NFC folder etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
and so after its downloaded, do i drag and drop the fold named flipper-main to the root of the sd card?

click on the green code button, download as a zip file and you have all the files already sorted

The only thing we can absolutely rely on is change.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
The whole point is that we're so popular that even the Chinese clones can't top our price point. You just can't get the components as the price we get them unless you have the scale that we do, and the bigger we become, the harder it gets for therm.

Youre riding that line, you want to be popular and sell a lot of units (done!) but you dont so much success that you fall victim to a Chinese clone. Interesting place to be.

1 : 2022-07-11
Mount your sd card to your pc; use UberguidoZ git hub folder tree as a general idea how to organize everything.

[there's also a couple videos showing general overview ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qp78fiDD5M&amp;t=1312s)

By far, IMO the best SD card for the flipper is one that has some free space.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Lol we got so played in the EU  imagine ignoring Kickstarter, ignoring whole pre-orders, and then just going to lab401, and getting it week later in the mail - before the European batch is even expedited

1 : 2022-07-11
Scripts you can make your flipper run on a computer
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
that makes sense! Thank you for response!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
The hardware is mostly open, but you absolutely can't recreate it. You'll need factory-assembled components (like our PCB antennas for NFC and RFID), and some components like the displays are specifically made for us, and can't be bought anywhere. Not to mention that arduinos have a completely different MCU (atmega in the arduino and STM32WB55 in the flipper), and ours can only be bought as an expensive nucleo board or only in large quantities. Same goes for our NFC chip, the ST25R3916 and many more components. 

In short, you absolutely can't recreate it with an arduino without it costing like a few thousand dollars to assemble.

That's why we don't have any competiton, too. Assembling the flipper at our price point requires at least the same manufacturing scale as we do, and no one do this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
That just makes it worse. 
I placed my order march 10.........2021! And i still haven't got mine. I'm in Europe though, but still, it's becoming very frustrating to see everyone getting it in a month or two. And I'm "lucky" cause i didn't do the Kickstarter, those people have waited even more.

I'm happy for you guys though. But now i want mine too. Still happy for you. Also crying on the inside. But mainly happy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11

I had something similar happen, my payment was cancelled but then went through. Id reach out to their support.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Honestly save your money for now, until there is more support added to the device. The software is still basically in beta. If you really want to get into (ethical) hacking, youre better off getting a raspberry pi and installing kali linux
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
I have a Mircom tag as well but no serial number :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
No, the region codes that define allowed frequencies are stored in the OTP (one-time programmable) memory and are not part of the firmware. The firmware is the same for all devices, no matter the region. Only the OTP region is different.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Oh I didn't notice the EU files in there  will go try them
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
It voids the warranty and you can only have one firmware but yes you can. I believe Flipper has distributed that firmware. The real question is whether there exists a script to do the same thing to UK teslas
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
No chance with [that one](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Sub-GHz/Vehicles/Tesla)?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Cant we put the American firmware on a uk device tho?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Install the Unleashed Firmware. Then download the 433 version of the subghz tesla file.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Lol despite all the time I took to make this, I did it because I'm lazy too ha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
There's a supercharger only about 20 miles from me.  I'm planning on going up the road to see if I can capture the signal some time soon.  If I do, I'll share.  I haven't found anyone sharing the file as yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
I believe the frequencies are different for all RF. Thats why the  UK couldnt buy the American FLipper and vise versa
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
No
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Will future boards have it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
This can actually help with that as well, if you encode a script in base64, when you decode it with your keyboard layout it will convert it to work for you
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Most definitely 
I'll start trying to see what I can do
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
Still, we haven't officially tested it yet, so no guarantees there.

Oh, and I just remembered, the web updater uses the same update method as the mobile app, so it won't work for the 0.4x factory firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11
I realized that my package is processing, that means the flipper zero hasn't even left manufacturer warehouse!!! :'( I don't know how many more months I will have to wait...
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-11

1 : 2022-07-11
I also converted a bunch of my payloads to work specifically for the flipper and made a repo just for them. Enjoy

Second this
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
I typically see people saying get a 4GB itll be fine, but my advice card is around 30 gigs without redundant garbage on it.

Ive been using a 256GB until I figured out how much Id really use. If youre using it daily and religiously checking for new content Id recommend a 32 or 64 gig just to be on the safe side.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
This sounds amazing for lazy people like me! Thank you for the repease!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Not only to keeloq. It is specific to rolling code protocols class in general.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
&gt;If you clone a key they have a counter in them so if you use the flipper then the existing key loses sync

Is this specific to remotes that use keeloq?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Yea dude I wanted the wifi dev board and screen protectors but that was just too much for right now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
To my knowledge, and from a quick google search, I'm pretty sure it does:
https://web.dev/build-for-webusb/

&gt; ChromeOS is based on Linux as well and also does not require any modification to system configuration. The permission_broker service controls access to USB devices and will allow the browser to access them as long as there is at least one unclaimed interface.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Yes, but I'm not sure if ChromeOS supports webUSB needed for updating
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
&gt; Yes, you need a PC that can run qFlipper (Windows, macOS, Linux) to do the first update (ChimeOS is not supported, sadly)

Maybe not anymore, as of recently, you can update via the browser
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Handicap doors?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Probably not, as you need full USB pass-through and custom udev rules.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Could you emulate iclass on it? 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Quick question, I'd love to buy one as I have missed the Kickstarter and have found out about Flipper Zero recently, are there plans for it to be available in other colors in the store? Might be a dumb question but I'm aware it was available in black during the campaign.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
It was a great phone phone for hacking/messing about with. I installed pwnphone and had some fun with WiFi back in the day since it supported injection and monitor mode.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
That's a useless idea. Go ahead and spray it, it will come right off after a couple of times handling it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Does it work on all apartment type of locks? I'm thinking about buying one cause I have a small remote for my apartment garage, a drop tag for all doors and then a seperste drop tag for work. I'd like to combine all in one thing. My apartment drop tag says dormakaba, the others I don't know what kind of brand/device they are
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
You can run Linux on a Chromebook with [crostini](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux). I wonder if that can run qFlipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
I ended up reading the card 3 more times. Finally on the 3rd try it got all 32/32 keys and was able to properly Emulate the door key.

How come it wouldn't find all the keys the first couple of times? Arent they part of a dictionary a list or is there something else going on actually cracking something?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Industry standard tools are more complex, higher cost, and usually hyper focused on a specific aspect that flipper covers with much broader tools for that specific aspect.

Suggesting someone invest in expert tools when they dont even have a handle on the basics is just silly. Especially when they dont even know what they are intending to focus on.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Thank you I will try.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Also you'll have to add your app to build configuration in fbt_options.py (or applications/meta/application.fam file).

I use mine mostly for car stuff. Program my keyfobs in, it unlocks my house etc. I'm not by any means a hacker nor do I work in anything it. But its a fun little toy and I like messing with it and learning about the stuff it has. If you have the money and it won't hurt you to buy it than go ahead

I looked at some YouTube videos of folks using the spray, as you mentioned.  That appears to be the way to go.  I havent used the spray before.


The last time I used PlastiDip, I had a USB thumb drive with a broken connector.  I removed the connector, soldered on a piece of chopped up USB cable, then dunked the whole thing.  It looked sus as f, but it worked!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
instead of the physical dip kind i was thinking using the spray cans, and masking off whatever i wanted to keep original (and putting plugs in the gpio holes)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Thats an interesting idea.  The PlastiDip coating is pretty thick, though, so I bet it would not fit back together if you dipped one piece at a time.  You might be able to dip the unit as a whole but you would never get it apart cleanly again.  That and you would have to work out not dipping the screen/controls.


I saw a bit years ago where someone PlastiDipped the dashboard of a car being restored and it looked pretty good in the end.  They thinned it with some sort of solvent and brushed it on.

Anyway, interesting idea.  Please post if you try it.

1. No, the PC is mostly needed only for the first-time install
2. Yes, you need a PC that can run qFlipper (Windows, macOS, Linux) to do the first update (ChimeOS is not supported, sadly)
3. It's easy to use the existing features, but adding something new requires coding skills and a PC
-------------------------------

That's a good shout actually. I've emailed them on their support email. Thanks very much for your help

Well when your flipper arrives from the factory, it'll have an old testing firmware that does not yet support updating via the mobile app.


**HOWEVER** a few months back, there was a blog post where they said it's planned to make a new factory image that has the capability to update from the mobile app.

The best thing you can do is to ask the flipper staff directly - that if you *order* today, if it'll have that new fw from the factory which can be update via the app!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Thanks for the reply. 

Just to clarify you *have* to update it via the PC first? Or can this update be done on the mobile app? I'm very limited on having a computer at the moment unfortunately
-------------------------------

Flipper Zero is all-round tool. That means it's doing lots of things, but none of which can be utilized on an "expert" level.

That means if you don't really know yet whether you want to "learn hacking" or what specifically you'd enjoy learning (RF? RFID? OneWire? SPI? Other gpio uses?), Just get flipper to get into it a bit.


Then, later, you can spend more money on more expert - grade tools like hackrf one / proxmark / or maybe even some oscilloscope. You'll know when you'll need it.

here it looks like the latest revision (as far as i can tell) at 54 seconds you can see the antenna port in their 3d model. the more i look into this the more information i find, but still no direct mention of it in any documentation.
-------------------------------

i beg to differ, the picture of the main board on the flipper zero website has the connector on it, and it does not look like some homebrew addon, it looks like it belongs there.

second why would they use a picture on their own website of a user modded board.

there is also a picture here

[https://blog.flipperzero.one/september-progress/](https://blog.flipperzero.one/september-progress/)

of an old and new revision, the new one is the black board that i keep seeing pictures of with the connector (although the screen blocks it in this picture.)

&amp;#x200B;

there is also a picture here

that shows a green circuit board with 2 ports labeled tuning port and 50 ohm aux port.

Oh and most importantly, you really shouldnt buy Flipper right now because theres barely any documentations in how to use it. 


Youre be better off buying industry standard tools that have guides and tutorials, especially  if youre just starting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
It really depends what field of hacking you want to get into. Flipper mostly covers radio frequency hacks. 

If you just want to get into hacking, I would recommend getting a descent wifi card instead, which would introduce you to WPS/WPA2/WEP hacking. Something like the ALFA Network AWUS036ACH. 

If you want to get into Radio frequency hacking, HackRF is a much better tool, although not easy to learn and more expensive, but at least you can actually use it. 

For LF fob and card cloning, theres lots of cheap Chinese products. For HF RFID theres the proxmark3, but it costs a lot of money. 

The flipper has potential to become a great hacking tool, but only once the software becomes better.
-------------------------------

How to track my order ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Thanks for the honest feedback, truly. Could you recommend any devices to get into/learn about hacking? 
I liked the flippers design and it being something I can just stick in my bag and go, so anything like that would be fantastic
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
I wouldnt purchase it yet, especially if youre tight on money. At the moment, the software is barely functional and requires a lot of research and manual fiddling. 
Theres better and cheaper ways to get into hacking that wont cost you anything and much better tools if you want to get into LF/HF RFID hacking . 

I work as a penetration tester and I have slight regrets buying this since theres much better tools. If Id buy it for personal use, I would definitely have buyers remorse.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
The connector is a user-added mod, the Flipper never had it from the factory (and probably never will)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-10
Hey, I also have the same gate system. The way to manually add a new key fob (On my gates anyway) is by pressing the button on the back of a working fob and then pressing both buttons on the front at the same time on the new fob. You do need to be fairly close to the control unit for the gates as both fobs have to communicate back. 

I've been looking into how to add my flipper as a remote, but I haven't really gotten very far yet. If you manage to get yours working, let me know how.

Really appreciate your time replying tkerby.

This is the fob, with some of it's specs  
[https://bft-automation-uk.mybigcommerce.com/mitto-b/](https://bft-automation-uk.mybigcommerce.com/mitto-b/)

The control panel manuals ([https://www.bftautomationuk.com/downloads/instruction-manuals.html#50-control-panels](https://www.bftautomationuk.com/downloads/instruction-manuals.html#50-control-panels)) give no hint as to how you add a key to the gate.  


However there is this youtube video that shows how to pair a new fob! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QXMBKI\_-Ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QXMBKI_-Ls)  
So it seems I need to figure out how I can assist in getting the zero to become a key. I'm a software dev by trade so happy to roll my sleeves up if I can help, this feels like a fun project. Maybe I can write a Bft plugin for the zero?

I picked up some Mifare NFC 13.56 MHz chips. They are designed for all sorts of NFC objects. They're very tiny. Some of them are very thin and inexpensive for disposable paper tickets. 

You can't do anything with the chip by itself. It requires an attached antenna in order for it to be discovered by the Flipper. I had to research the design requirements for the antennas and come up with a way of building them. I used thin copper wire wrapped around plastic boxes. 

Attaching the chips to the home-built antennas proved to be difficult. I went with an old-school soldering iron and a light touch. They worked on the first try! These are fresh chips, ready to be programmed. All they have is their serial number. 

I just finished building them earlier today. I have not figured out how to program them. I'll post some pictures tomorrow.

No jack. If you needed one you'd either have to add your own or add an additional radio on the gpio port.

It would take months of explaining to tell you what each one does. Research them on Google as I will not spoon feed you unless you are going to pay me for explaining what each of them does. Down vote me all you want but this stuff takes years for experience to use, so go on and learn.

Just a quick question:

Norway is not on the list of countries you ship to. We are not a member of EU, but we do have access to the EU internal market via the EEA agreement.

Furthermore, you \*do\* ship to the UK and they are no longer part of the EU, so:   
Could you please extend the list of countries you ship to, to Norway as well? We really is a quite civilized country up here in the North. :)

Any chance you can publish on GitHub the source code for this project? I'm very interested in the code used to hook up the modules with the Flipper because I'm trying to do a similar thing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
&gt;since it requires a brand name card

Yes. But not because of the speed. But since it's much less widespread than sdio, manufacturer mainly focus on making sdio work and often just "5hrow spi support on the top" resulting in a card that performs great with your phone, but flipper (and other embedded devices) might even find it "defective" (for their purposes anyway)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
Well, it's good to know the extra 4 bucks I spent on R/W speed are going to good use LOL. I assumed SPI mode was faster since it requires a brand name card

You might be able to add a key on the gate using add manual but only when the flipper team get the manufacturer key for that gate. If you clone a key they have a counter in them so if you use the flipper then the existing key loses sync and you would have to press the button multiple times to get back to a code thats not already been used from the flipper. Hence creating a key and adding it to the gate is the way to do this
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
Most people could get by perfectly fine with 4-8GB. Its getting harder to find them under 16 or 32GB in stores these days so Id just get 16 or 32.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
Thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
Thank you all. Happy to assist where I can, but don't want to deauth a key fob. I'd really like to learn why that would happen though. I'm also interested to know how the gate manufacturer can sell us working key fobs, presumably they have a private key we don't. In which case maybe I can brute force that? Maybe it's not gate specific though. 

We have three key fobs for the gate and just wanted to use this as a fourth.

I will get some reads from all three key fobs tonight. Is there a way to export the data from the Flipper, as it cannot be saved?

I'll also try to figure out manufacturer etc.

Cheers

&gt;I could also picture someone using the Flipper as a flashdrive and using all 128 supported GB.

Yeah, if you want 128GB usb drive with about 1MBps transfer speeds, be my guest.
Flipper connects to an SD card using spi instead of sdio which is much slower.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-09
I believe codes that can be captured can only be saved by using a custom firmware, like Unleashed or Roguemaster. Correct me if I'm wrong please.

It depends. The most common uses don't require much data, but with custom firmware and modules, it is possible you'll wish you had more. One custom firmware has a WAV player, and WAV files get pretty large. I could also picture someone using the Flipper as a flashdrive and using all 128 supported GB. However, these are edge cases, and many people probably wouldn't be able to justify buying a larger card unless they had a use case in mind. I'm happy with my 32 GB card right now, but I'm also wondering if I'll wish I had more down the line

I have a 128gb SD (because Im a sucker for storage space) but Ive loaded it with almost everything on the awesome flipper GitHub, plus whatever Ive captured and saved, and Ive only used 5.5gb of storage space.

Once again, you'll get fob clone but old fob will be deauthorized(unusable). To me it doesn't sounds like lawful usage.

We may add your vendor manufacture key(for that we need raw record of any fob by that manufacturer) to firmware to decipher payload, but there will be no save button because of the protocol nature.
-------------------------------

Thank you. I've not seen a company use a placeholder like that before. Do you know if it's common with international shipping??

Flipper supports the Security+ 1 &amp; 2 protocols which are rolling codes to my knowledge. These are widely used amongst Liftmaster products in the US, and how I was able to capture my garage opener.

A rolling code is hackable since it is nothing more than an algorithm to determine the next code. What is needed is teaching the Flipper the correct protocol so it knows any stagnant codes expected plus the algorithm used to generate the rolling code.

TN was just a temporary holder location. The plane actually landed in Chicago, IL so it most likely never was in TN.
-------------------------------

OMG I actually had the same phone. It currently sits in the drawer but it still works!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
True. But youd be surprised how much stuff isnt secured. I know plenty of garage doors (including the one that I use daily) that doesnt use rolling codes. Plenty of NFC systems too. 

Sure. All of these things can be done with different devices. Proxmark, SDRs, TV-B-Gone and the like. But Flipper is one handy all-in-one tool.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Done, sorry.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Without being a neggy nancy..

garage doors - every garage door worth their salt (and gates too) use rolling codes (same as car remote fobs)) which flipper doesn't support (in normal firmware, but I can't see how it works in other firmware either tbh).   The best I've done is to open my cars frunk/boot a handful of times after 'sniffling', recording and playing back the signal ... but it stops working after a very short period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

RFID - again, most cards out there seem to be using protocols not supported by flipper or encrypted.  

TV's - did all that from a Casio watch in the 80's ... thats no big deal. 

Tesla charge port might be amusing after a couple of goes.. but its not really much annoyance for the owner.  maybe a little confusing.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but think that this device has a lot more use in somewhere like its home country of Russia where garages/remotes/rfid cards etc are using crappy old insecure protocols... but unless you find a garage door that is 30+ years old, its unlikely to find a lot of use in the UK :(

has this made its way into a PR yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
It's been saying that for a month.  That would also contradict what FZ has said in their shipping updates.  Expected departure was July second
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
I like that you went through the extra effort (especially on the p4wnpi) to make it all portable without a battery back.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
No expert here, but is it something you cant do with your smartphone? I write data into some NFC tags using mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Oh I bet! Cant wait to get mine and see what stuff I can do

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."

"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

It might be a little confusing when people get back.. but its funny shit to do, just like turning off tv menus ect
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
You are correct! Saved me from explaining all of them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
I always wondered if you couldn't push some sort of attack on that frequency since it doesn't ALWAYS work and the car seems to have some control over the port. 

I have noticed I cannot pop the charge doors of teslas that are "closed". Mirrors folded in, doors locked.  


I have noticed that I can pop covers of teslas that are "open" mirrors out, idk if doors are unlocked but I would assume so.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
That looks like it's saying it arrived in TN on Jun 20th, and has finally made it across the country to IL on Jul 7th; eventually it will be transferred to the post office for last-mile delivery.

just guessing.

hackrf portalack in a 3d printed case with mayhem firmware.

tinypi or tinypi pro portable raspberry pi gaming device.

p4wnpi possibly a.l.o.a. running off a pi sugar battery.

pwnagotchi also running off the same or similar battery module as the p4wnpi.

one of travis lin's dstike esp8266 deauthers running off of a 18650 battery in a 3d printed case.

flipper zero with a 3d printed carrying case.

recurring theme here is they all are portable by running off usb-rechargeable batteries.
to better fit the theme, the p4wnpi &amp; pwnagotchi could also be in 3d printed cases.

but i could be wrong.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
On top is a ESP8266 Deauther.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Are you offering these for sale in the US?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Charge ports also have communication functionality, and who knows how well this is isolated from the rest of the car. There have been many instances where the infotainment bus is coupled with the vehicle management, so the idea that the charging infrastructure might be too is not a huge leap.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Download the Tesla charge door open file, this has been well received by all in my house. My 6 year old loves going out to hack teslas
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
It's not even just a matter of decrypting them, they have their own cryptographic processor, etc, I'm not sure the entire protocol is public.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
I mean it should be locked and now it isnt. Even if its just the feeling people get from it its not something you want to have to answer questions about as a brand.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Depends on how you look at it. Its just the charge port. You cant open doors or anything.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Ooh I see. That seems like a glaring vulnerability if Ive ever seen one. Didnt expect that oversight from Tesla of all companies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
The thing itself. 

It has a radio in it that you activate with a button. When you press it, it sends out a 433Mhz signal that opens the charge port.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
You can capture a signal at a supercharger? Like from someones card or just at the thing itself?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
That's what I thought, I was under the impression it wouldn't work but not tried it myself incase I wiped my card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Try opening some garage doors
Try cloning a RFID access card
Try opening a Tesla charge port (you can capture the signal at a supercharger)
Try turning off some TVs in public places (big box retailer?)

Theres lots of fun to be had
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Like others said it doesnt work. That would be a huge flaw in the contactless system. Its fun to try tho and it does tell you what type of bank card and manufacturer you are with.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Right side is a hackrf in a portapack configuration of sorts with a 3D printed case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
You can do this with any NFC enabled Android phone already. Also bank cards are encrypted so you won't be able to clone them without decrypting them first.

Interested in the Flipper so looking for where it has its uses.
-------------------------------

Yeah, I only two I immediately recognize are the FlipperZero and the Pwnagotchi.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-08
Sooo, whatre we looking at?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
It can read the numbers, but can't actually emulate the whole emv spec...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Sounds like a problem for my SDR, but war driving style. 

Thanks for the tip.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
I looked into this and I think that these transponders work off UHF which is not supported by the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
How'd the bank card clone go?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Just hold off. They say in the discord that accessories will be on Amazon in near future.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Probably has to do with the device being so open source. I'm guessing it has something to do with encryption or how it stores 2FA. Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll get better!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Yeah that's what I heard also
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
No?  I thought it had a pin setting to stop just anyone from using it. Not sure how secure it is, though. I've not seen anything about it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Heard that's it's not very secure way to store 2fa keys though
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Ordered, I'm in USA...I  look forward to joining the fellow dolphins

1 : 2022-07-07
Totally! Im hoping it opens up a new hobby that I will
Enjoy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Oh thats awesome!  I wish I had a friend like that.  Were trying to teach ourselves to code. From what Im seeing the basics are easy, its trying to do the more complex things, like the display Wi-Fi passwords script that gets tricky. That said you can always be a script kiddie and ask your friend and the general community to help you make them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Yes, the region of the device is determined by your shipping address
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
I have 2 units and only 1 vehicles to use them on,  we sold our second vehicle last year. So no, I'm not looking to clone or anything. 

I just want to check it out and experiment with what I can do with the second unit: can I write to it? What data does it transmit? What's the difference between the sides?  (It has a slide that allows one to switch between HOV and TOLL modes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
My buddy owns an IT company and has one and convinced me to buy it. I have zero experience doing code or anything so Im hoping I will still be able to have fun with it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Meanwhile I'm still waiting on my Kickstarter backing. This is getting painful.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Thats awesome!!!  Im already talking with friends about what were gonna do, and getting more. Im hoping to get a 3D printer at some point to make the black case for mine. Im thinking of changing a few things up as far as aesthetics go, add a design or something to it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Me too, got to pre-order for august delivery today.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Well most of the other stuff will work, I'm pretty sure...


Also the frequency limits as implemented in the software that is... "Modifiable"... 

Or so I heard 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Yup. Sorry it didnt format right. I copied it off of Discord. Ive saved all of those and found many things I cant wait to use when mine arrives

what is your end goal? are you looking to duplicate the signal for multiple vehicles? last time i checked, EZ-Pass units can be swapped between vehicles of the same vehicle class. i found some articles online on possible frequencies that EZ-Pass use, but im not sure if is the same technology that this device uses.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07

Same tho
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
First time seeing a mooltipass, that's pretty cool.
I wonder if you can implement the flipper to act like it, I'm guessing badUSB can kind of do that but seems like a hassle to set up.
-------------------------------

Sorry sold it already.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Where do you ship from?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
It's.
On the 401 website.
In the big.
Red.
Letters.

If you haven't noticed it, no way you can get refund.

And yes. They are the EU frequencies version...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Yes absolutely! We are currently in the process of setting up fulfillment centers in Europe and the US so we can get faster shipping times for cheaper costs :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Would love some screen covers - however, 18 bucks shipping seems a bit rough. 

I get why, though, since at the end of the day material needs to make its way from point a to b, but is there any plan to cut down regional shipping costs?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
I believe the only ones that have existed, were from the first pre-orders. And even if somebody had one that wasn't redeemed yet! It'll be expired by now :(

1 : 2022-07-07
Probably late August. Seems like there is a high demand for this batch which will delay everything
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Yes, the store page specifically mentions **SHIPPING IN AUGUST 2022**
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
If Im reading it right, I think its expected to arrive in TN Sunday. A day or so for them to make sure its legal, than theyll start sending them out to people. 
Im hoping that itll arrive either the end of next week, or early the following week
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Please keep in mind I do not yet have my flipper, and Im going off of memory from what Ive seen others say. 

For your parking structure I believe youd need to find someone who does have a pass and make a copy. I do not know if/how youd determine whats needed. Maybe a proper script in badusb could pull the info off the computer and send it to you, but thats way above me

I believe it does have a [frequency analyzer](https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/frequency-analyzer). If its a supported one than it would let you know. The stock software does limit what frequencies you have access to, maybe a unofficial one can help you if it falls outside of the allowed ranges.  
I believe you can also access the FCC info for that device and see what it broadcasts on as well
-------------------------------

Hey how do you do this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Same. I hope they can get a US seller onboard so shipping can drop. I'll just have to keep being extra careful
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07

Don't forget the email said they are still trying to finish off the 10% of orders from Kickstarter. They opened up the ability to pre-order to know how much demand there will be for August batch. I don't think we are getting ours any time soon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Mine was instant.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
I was gonna buy the screen protectors and the case, but yikes..18 bucks for shipping and it wouldn't even arrive for another month.

If anybody wants a black one now, Im selling mine. PM me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
There aren't any coupons available by any chance? With shipping and tax it just jumps over the barrier where I'd pull the trigger. Did Lab401 already set a price for these?

How did you get that "searching for Keys" thing? I didn't find that in any of the sections that came with the device

I literally know nothing about coding and wanted to dick around with it lol I need to get a parking pass for the parking structure next to me since it's covered. Can I scan a parking station and create a key based on the scan?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
Awesome. The ebay resellers can get rekt. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-07
I mean they arent in stock they are on pre-order and will be shipping in August. But still, buy them while you can!

Damn.
Wanna buy but I'm waiting for Lab 401 to stock up...

For everyone else: this was in the #general channel.

There really isn't much you can do with a remote, most of the "good stuff" is only accessed by the admin interface, which requires physically opening the jukebox and pressing a button. with the remote, you can skip songs, pause, and "power on/off" which isn't actually powering it off, but putting it in a sleep state. You can add promo credits *if* the location is set up for it, but locations get credits based on how much the juke is played. Once you use their credits, it has to build back up. 

Did you have something specific in mind?
-------------------------------

I was hoping to be able to run qFlipper on my Pinephone (Manjaro/KDE), this should be very helpful to get me pointed the right way. Thanks!

Well shit, that's really unfortunate.
Best you can hope for is contacting the new renter/owner and see about them taking delivery for you.

Looks like this has been mentioned on the flipper forums. Not good news unfortunately- https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/paxton-fob/3842

Not all Europeans. Backers are waiting, whoever bought to Lab401 already have theirs for some days so far. (Even faster than the UK last mile deliveries)

You are a saint! I'm fortunate to have a windows env to update from, and hadn't circled back to getting it running on my *nix boxes. Thank you, I'll try this tonight.

Awesome!

I'm in the same boat lol. Mine is Tl4dz0.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
See this is the kinda knowledge I need to learn and know
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
gates/garages are a bit pointless (in the default firmware) as it doesn't support rolling/dynamic codes.   so basically any gates/garages worth anything at all, wouldn't work with flipper. 

Other firmware like flipper unleashed apparently does, but i've not worked out exactly how they are setup
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
I did see the UK gate, but cannot seem to find pictures of it online so I don't know how common they are around the country
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
There is a big GitHub repo with a lot of downloads, I am assuming this is the one you may have found. There is a UK specific gate listed there which sounds interesting.

I managed to get the Tesla ones to run, but I am using the unleashed firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
I've managed to program all the TVs around my house, the xbox controller and also the universal remote is a big upgrade from my old TV-B-Gone I used to love back in the day
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Most of the infrared seem to work fine too  the TV, steaming, etc files all seem to work. Theres just a lot of US brands in there that we dont usually have here.

The Berlin Wall is gone. No need to wait for freedom.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Brilliant, thanks for the advice. I wouldn't of thought EU would of included UK
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
There are some in there that are UK/EU relevant. For instance, look for the labels containing EU in the Tesla sub-ghz for files that work in the UK. Im also interested to know if theres any more UK specific ones, though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Don't worry, all Europeans are waiting, there is little left!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
solved.  
After installing and uninstalling the application several times and without doing anything different, it finally worked.  :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Thank you Pavel.

Ok, so I just noticed I was actually in touch with [support@flipperdevices.com](mailto:support@flipperdevices.com). I have now reached out to [support@flipperzero.one](mailto:support@flipperzero.one) (is this the same team?).

But I got a similar response "Unfortunately, we are simply not able to change addresses at this point, as your order has already been packed and will be departing our warehouse soon."

I don't see a ticket number, but my order# is: 18837.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
It arrived on Saturday and the shipping updated on the Monday after that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Just received mine today via EVRI - was showing what you described up until 2 days ago from the 15th June...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Update, tracking number is updated and looks like it is on its way :-D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
EU ETA is 6 jul. After that it will require customs clearance and last mile delivery.

Can you try with a different phone?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
I did this 4 times last night todo 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
I literally moved a few days before I got the shipping notification from the courier..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Try a dfu reset using the desktop app. Hold the back button and left for 30 seconds then plug it into the pc. The qflipper app on the pc should give you an option to repair it. That will reflash the whole OS.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
Shiiii sorry, hopefully they'll email you back
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-06
This was my last update: Shipping Partner:  OSM WORLDWIDE 
Your item was picked up by a shipping partner at 5:06 am on June 20, 2022 in SMYRNA, TN 37167. This does not indicate receipt by the USPS or the actual mailing date. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
After formatting a different card, rebooting and reflashing, I made an attempt to format SD card in the flipper, got a message that said file system not ready tried again and get internal error every time after. Sending the info to mom n dad, will update when its figured out. 

Thanks again fellow weirdos

My accessories are schedule for this Sunday
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
thats a posability  those things do happen but  it could also be a software glitch among other things.   rember the device is open source and  still fairly new     so theres bound to be bugs and glitches that need to be figured out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
likely hardware then, i assume?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
now i agree with the contact suport guy cause  the issues with storage size shouldnt happen on below 32. and the reason i asked you on brand shouldnt happen with scandisk atleast... ( basicly the card has to  suport a standard thats an old standard  that most cheap cards no longer suport but  scandisk and a few other major brands still put them in mostcards)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Check diacors guys. But, is passing customs in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
They never were in Smyrna, thats just where the courier (which will drop them in USPS mail soon) cut all the shipping labels. Once the shipping label is cut, you see the tracking data for it but the item was not there.

In the Discord, the mods have said they made it from Hong Kong to the US and are now clearing customs. Once they clear customs, the courier will get them. The courier will label them and drop them into the mail. At that point your tracking number will being to show you relevant locations and ETAs.

As it turns out, he got caught and almost got expelled. Its going on eBay where Ill probably make my money back and then some. Dumb ass.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
The part Im confused about, initially it was made to sound like this currently shipping batch of US bound FlipperZeros were already in country.

Now its sounding like they were in Hong Kong.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Ive been to Smyrna!  Meh, nothing special. :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
I bought one from aliexpress and it does fine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Same 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Yep, it's a problem that has been present for a while now - everything from simple pattern recognition(Ie, the face detection in cameras) to full-on facial recognition(ie, passport control in airports - NIST estimates with testing that error rates are 10 times higher), and infared sensors like auto sinks and so on, even stuff like light-based heart rate sensors all struggle with darker skin tones.

Researchers are working on it, but it still remains to be seen if there will be any serious solutions at this time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Ay np bb 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
whats the brand / size of the cards you have tried  ( yes both of these can be important)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Sounds harsh to say but you kinda fucked yourself there by not updating your shipping information when you moved.

That said, I didn't get the address lock-in either.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
According to a comment from a Mod in discord they are still clearing customs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Mine arrived today. Wishing I'd ordered the WiFi board now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
I've gotten two updates, one saying it was preparing to ship, and another saying that it was about to depart Hong Kong.  As u/nasteal pointed out, it is still showing the location is Smyrna TN, and says USPS is awaiting the item.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
They were packaged and sent out July 2nd. My current eta is July 10th.  Use this link to check for more updates. https://ship.flipp.dev/

Tracking number went hot when it was handed off to the courier yesterday. Package arrived this afternoon

I so wish I had a black one lol 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Will give that a spin. Thanks got the rec 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Yes. It'll sit in Tennessee until it lands from Hong Kong and clears customs. It was covered in their blog and via email.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
This is probably the answer or if you have a lot of codes doesnt it take awhile to load
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Sadly I don't have access to any of our shipping controls, only the support email staff does.

I think people have asked u/astrrra for help on issues. Maybe they can do something or explain it in a better way??

Unfortunately it's not the postal system, but a courier that delivers the Flippers in Europe. Thanks though!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
That would work if I was in the USA but I'm in Europe :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Thanks, contacting [support@flipperzero.one](mailto:support@flipperzero.one) is exactly what I did.

At first they were quite responsive. I tried to explain my sitation several times and that I'm stuck in a loop without their help, I just need them to message the courier and update the address (as the courier refuses to update it unless the shipper says so).

But since their last "Like stated before, we are not able to make any changes at this point." message, it appears they have chosen to just ignore me.

I kind of regret backing incharge, they're so bulky and I barely ever used them
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
ive never had this issue personally, but the only solution i can suggest is to contact your old town/cities post office or go on the post offices website and request all mail sent there with your name on it be forwarded to your new address. it is a federal crime for someone to open your mail (with your name on it) even if it is not your current address. hope this helps!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
Try talking with the USPS office. Maybe they can place a hold on your mail and keep it at the post office. Once it says it's delivered you can go to the office and pick it up
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-05
I'm also from Germany.  everything should be included in the price

Did you just read RAW on a really long press?  Still cool just curious lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Did it show up as that freq in the freq analyzer and did you try to, " read raw"? Stock firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Try to format it from Flipper's menu
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Will open shop tomorrow.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Your tracking number will be traceable only when container will be opened in Amsterdam.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Its like Elon himself named the flippers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Weird. I'm in Germany. I have a notification that DHL has been notified (tracking number issued) but that they haven't yet received the goods to be sent.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
So, will there be any in the Shop or are you focusing on flipper one next?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Mine said it was "two business days" delivery, but was "in transit" for about 16 days. Took a couple of weeks from getting the email from Flipper to getting an EasyShip notification.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
They never specified in what context they were equating null to 0. In fact in common literary usage null does in fact mean zero.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Interesting. I figure the newer signs may have smaller more compact remotes like that. Dunno.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
My great grandmother just presses the buttons on the dial pad. Its on a TriStar 3980.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I would contact support
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Its definitely been addressed by the devs more than once.   There is infact going to be more tamagotchi style to it but right now the tools are the focus, not so much the virtual pet part.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Well now there needs to be a "rugged" case for it that's water proof and has a sealed magnetic/contact charging passthrough to the usb...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
In 1337speak 0 is definitely the letter o.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Is there any way to script macros yet? Or do you have to hardcode it in firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
That's actually how most of those signs work. Inside the station, there's a remote that changes the prices. The video is likely the manager of the gas station using it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
That's the pronunciation that I keep leaning towards 

At least yours isn't a total tongue twister
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Hm, I'd say O-proxy for that personally. Mine is called Dleine, which is remarkably pronouncable but almost a bit vanilla
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
While I have no doubt that it is true that it is cost efficient to manufacture SKUs in bulk and ship them in bulk to distribution centers, once they've been delivered to the distribution center it seems to me to be a different ball of yarn altogether.

1 : 2022-07-04
You might be right honestly
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Lol I sync to my phone :) so I'll always have the files to replay , 1 press deploy is great (fm) modulation
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Winches have coded remotes , I just learned the rf and have timers for the sla bed to fully deploy 1min 5 seconds and done
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I think you have to be an actual dolphin to pronounce that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
So you're saying you have the frequency or IRs for it? Care to share them?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
You have it easy, mine is Unmwml1we
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
But 0=/= null


Null is absence of information, 0 still contains information
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I've read it stated as a response to the common complaint of backers not getting theirs first.
A complicated manufacturing and shipping process, not helped by the current world and political climate must've gotten screwed up, I don't know the sweet and hairy of it sadly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
How do you figure that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Evri sent the email stating that they had received the package just 10min before it was delivered, thats some service!

Was delivered on a Sunday too which I thought was unusual for Evri/hermes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
It looks pretty fake to me. I dont see the purpose of why someone would even sell or make a remote that can do that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
O'Proxee  


Operator Zerox(e)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
when I see 0 as a letter and it's not O because that's already being used, I tend to think the 0 is pronounced 'null' or 'not'. So maybe

'Ohper-nullckszee'
'Ohper-notckszee'

 /shrug
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
ive ordered one, but once it arrives, i would be interested as well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
That's awesome! Just make sure you don't lose your flipper :O
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Price is set internally. Based off the rack price the station was charged.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Oh proxy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
'Oh-Proxy' ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I like that nick name
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Oper-Oxie, or Oxie for short?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I can only speak for the place I worked at, but for me they were all seperate. Not that it would affect the total on the register.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Worked at a Kroger kiosk through the plague. 

The price change would come though the cash register as a pop-up. You could accept it or snooze it. That may or may incur management consequences. For increase I would snooze the register pop-up and make the change with the remote. Mine had a widget you plugged into a special socket in the wall that looked like an XT keyboard port. 

If you accepted the change before fixing the sign sure as shit within 30 seconds some Karen is up in your face about the price being wrong. 

I would accept price drops immediately. Nobody ever complained about paying less than the sign.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
I do not know if this is true for all gas stations, but it was standard for the company I worked at about 10 years ago. The store manager or assistant manager would drive around, get the local prices of gas, report it to corporate. Latter corporate would tell us what to change the prices to. It was generally around noon-1. Im sure it wouldnt be hard to find the frequency they use.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Yeah I figured something like that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Yes this worked a treat:

STRING %USERPROFILE%
ALTSTRING \
STRING foldername
ALTSTRING \
STRING image.jpg
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
From my experience it was the sign only. The gas station I worked at the register was connected to the pumps, we used that to change the price on them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
The real question is whether that remote controls the prices in the pump alone, or if it affects the cost on the pump too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
So is there anything special going on here? Or is it just an rf remote?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Wouldn't it just be better to... USB-&gt;UART straight to the phone, without a flipper inbetween then? 

I'd like to be able to run the commands from the flipper \_without\_ the phone.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-04
Ive been trying to forget that I had ordered one (earlyKS) but prompted by your post, have just checked and mines out for delivery today (South Coast, UK), so thanks for the nudge!

I think this is a sign/remote combo that uses a PT2262 and PT2272.

Page 7 of [this datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/PT2262_C16390.pdf) has some good info
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
For me I have to select "Emulate Ultralight" after I've picked which amiibo to emulate. Then the Flipper always shows "Emulating Mf Ultralight" while it is configured for that card. My switch seems to detect it best when I put the Flipper Zero directly over the right joystick while the joycon is attached to the switch screen/body.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
and? Did it work ?

Except thats not actually true. Pre-orders in Europe have skipped the line on backers.

Thanks I'll give it a go. I think it's ALT 092 for backslash.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Use ALTSTRING instead of STRING. That did it for me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Hell yea spaceman. If you are interested in printing some Im down, Im not sure if youve got something in mind as a product or want someone to cover materials while you tinker lmk.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I noticed this right away, I have my keyboard on spanish and it'd cripple bad usb lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I remember that using Alt-codes should work around that as they are language independent.

**Impressively horrific**

Kickstarter, it has been a long wait!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Because of the existing body of software at this place, I was also doing this in VB6 using integer math, because VB6 doesn't have bitshift operators.

I don't know if that counts as impressive, or horrific, though.

(probably a bit of both ...)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
&gt;I remember writing libraries to do ridiculously tight packing - putting fields on arbitrary bit-boundaries, 6 bit datatypes for date information, etc.

Wow, consider me impressed!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Hmm Lab401 or kickstarter?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Was a a Yotel in London a week or two ago and was sad that Flipper hadn't arrived early enough - they have a kiosk and you write your own room cards using the reader, would have been cool to be able to write one to the Flipper (not sure the software emulates being a writable card for the purpose of recording one though).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I am in North west England and mine was delivered this morning
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Yeah, I had a job working with contactless cards about 15 years ago - and Mifare Classic (or Mifare 1k as it was) was broken even back then - you could crack the keys on Pentium class hardware fairly quickly.

Seeing a battery powered device doing it was fun though :-)

You get much less than 1KB of usable memory as well. I remember writing libraries to do ridiculously tight packing - putting fields on arbitrary bit-boundaries, 6 bit datatypes for date information, etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
16gb (or bigger), fast is beneficial 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I've been checking my tracking like mad, still not given it to Evri

How big an SD card would you say? I've got a spare 4gb,8gb and 16gb
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
My was picked up by evri on the 30th and has just sat on "Your parcel is being sorted at the senders local depot". Hopefully it won't take too much longer  as it was the 15th I first got my tracking from evri
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Evri don't have mine yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
How very strange, Im in Exeter so many the circle is so expanding? I got my first notification from Evri on like the 15th of June?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Yeah evri for last part, I had notification weeks ago and it was sat waiting arrival for weeks.. they (some?) landed in UK last week, passed customs and mine arrived Saturday.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Same! I guess Evri was your last mile Courier? Where roughly in the UK are you? It seems only around London/Essex is being delivered at the moment
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Early kickstarted 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I'm in the UK and had tracking code over a week ago but still waiting daily for Evri to update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Very nice! Couple questions, where did you buy it from? Kickstarter or Lab401? Myself and a few other backers are trying to track down why Evri (Hermes) hasnt delivered half of the flippers yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Really cool, I want to try to open my neighbors Teslas charging port hahahahaha. And also get my garage keys on it xD thank you for giving me new ideas 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Well I ordered the Wi-Fi add on board yesterday 
Initial tinkering was reading every NFC I had to had and a few more, easy cloning and straight forward emulation as well as reading all the extra data fields 
TV be gone works 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Thank you so much for the advice! Mine is in Hong Kong customs now! Any project you are willing to try?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
ebay has lots of people flipping their kickstarters for loadsa 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd prefer to keep mine 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I was backer 1,157 and the $119 early bird was well worth the wait (&amp; the extra shipping months back)

Well chuffed with great little tool!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
Thanks so much for this! I am having an issue though. I downloaded them all and added to the nfc folder, but I cant get my switch to recognise the amiibo while emulating. Ive reset the switch but it just wont recognise the emulated amiibo. Any suggestions?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
my kickstarter backed one arrived yesterday
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I downloaded the amiibos and added them to the nfc folder, but I cant get my switch to recognise the amiibo while emulating. Can I ask how you got it to work? Thank you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-03
I downloaded them all and added to nfc folder, but I cant get my switch to recognise the amiibo while emulating. Has anyone else had this problem?
-------------------------------

For the right price i could 3D print you a case in PLA or SLA resin
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-02
I will use if for usb security tool , but my job as a roadside tech I am using it to test car keys to see if they transmit to rule out key as a fault , also checking for interferences on key frequency causing issues
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-02
I think it would be easier to connect a microphone to the io and go from there
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-02
not really
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-02
I mean. It's not going anywhere...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Lab401 is the only distributor right now, but they have very few devices in the first EU batch, that's why they sold out right now. I hope in August-September Flipper will be available on  Amazon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
I've been looking at this lately as well.  It seems a more capable device than flipper, just not quite as portable.    


Any thoughts overall about the capabilities of the hackrf one over the flipper?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Look into marauders on GitHub. Pm me for discord links
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
I would love to. The Pwnagotchi is on my list of projects, but havent found anything to mimic the Zero. Does such a project exist with arduino/pi boards?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
All the real flipper OGs build their own. Get building. 

But probably check out the discord? Announcements or their website blog.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Why not just wait for Flipper team to announce? They send out emails whenever they have stock. You can also follow the Discord channels.

Haven't even received a tracking number yet...
Rest of the World got screwed 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Perfect color setup for the black unit, though! Nice work. I'd definitely do that if I had one of the black ones.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
What about an introverted one?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Nah I've got over a decade of doing rather similar work under my belt and the screws used in these are utter trash. I stripped the tits out of a single screw on mine and made one hell of a mess trying to extract it. This was using a high quality precision driver kit. 

Hopefully it's a fix we can see in future version. 

Maybe even actual threaded inserts so they're not just chewing into the plastic case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Ummm, my black flipper has a defect then - it's polarizing filter came oriented in light mode! JK :-P

Figured it was something like that, just thought I'd ask to be sure - thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
That's a part of the panel that's not covered by the control circuitry, so it can't be changed electronically, only by physically changing the polarizing filter
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Could firmware changes get rid of the light border or does the panel just always have a light border?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
Rule 2: r/flippersales
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
That happens when you use the wrong screwdriver bit. You need to use PH0 and PH0 only, or else that happens 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-07-01
The polarizing film I used comes with an adhesive layer, so yes, it's glued in place

use a 5/32" flathead in the phillips, may need to file the blade end a little so the corners are a bit pointy, the screw will come right out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Minarchisttrucker. It's some of my older videos lol I have bad ADHD so my videos are all over the place. 

If you search flipper zero on tiktok it will be like the highest liked video
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Whats your tiktok?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
My car doesn't have rolling code so I use it to lock my car because it has a farther range than my shitty keyfob. 

I also used it to make tiktok videos that went viral haha

And other than that I just use it to control infrared stuff until the magstripe emulation is a thing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
I would love to do this, the only problem is that I cant disassemble mine. The screws seem to be made of some cheap material (probably zinc) and one disintegrated beyond unscrewing with a couple of gentle turns. I get that it's probably not meant to be disassembled, but its a little frustrating how easily parts seem to get damaged/break on this thing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Are there still some available?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
So it's a similar process to the gameboy bivert? Is it all glued down or is the polarizing film just sitting in there?
-------------------------------

I like this mod

1 : 2022-06-30
About the same here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
That would leave the light border around them :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
There is was thinking you had simply taken the stock images, inverted and recompiled fw.  Good job &amp; creative approach too!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
To be clear, that's not how it came from the factory. I had to disassemble it, remove the display's stock polarizing film, and replace it with a new one, rotated 90

Don't recommend attempting this unless you absolutely know what you're doing lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Mine was delivered then two weeks later I was given the tracking info. Lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Thats probably not a bad idea. Anybody want a black flipper zero with no use?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Wow.  All of you that have used it once and put it in a box need to go ahead and recoup the funds you used to purchase it or it will soon be that $170 paperweight that you regret buying.

Now is the time to get it in the hands of someone who actually wants it.  If you wait too long the market will be saturated or the next rev will be dropping and the one you own will quickly lose any valuation.  Heck, if you only got $200 for it, you'd be halfway to a HackRF One or some other hack tool you've been eyeing.

Damn, I'm checking my shipping details every day. It's slightly annoying that Lab401 orders are arriving before preorder/kickstarter orders are arriving
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
I figured, but I keep checking the [international shipping](https://imgur.com/a/eqzdPOj) page hoping that bar is farther along
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Yea I had saw that, but I decided to wait until they release official docs on writing plugins.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
pretty sure not for flipper itself but there appears to be some tooling written in python in the repo (won't link here to avoid getting this deleted)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Can we write plugins for flipper in python? I thought everything was C or C++.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
looks like too old python version.

looks to be the walrus operator introduced in python 3.8: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions

fyi /u/0rphanCrippl3r
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Yeah according to the mods in the discord the US batch is being shipped July 2nd
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Ow I am the same!  I will keep a eye out for mine soon!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Another 7/10 estimate here.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Someone said that they arent state side yet which is why usps hasnt updated anything. Not entirely sure though
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Im checking it at least once a day, hoping for a change. Completely ignoring the fact Ive already signed up for text alerts with the USPS 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Yooo, yeah mine says estimated deliver 7/10 too 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Using brew versus docker is my guess...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
I got my email saying they were sending it 06/02.  Im guessing its going by boat because whenever I look the USPS hasnt gotten it, and it has a estimated arrival time of 07/10. Im not sure if thats to my house or the USPS shipping facility
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
yes, i set it to 310mhz and did read raw and played it and it did not work.

i also had a difficult time with frequency analyzer reading the remote for some reason.

it does have an fcc id on it. i will post that in teh forums
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
thank you i will follow this guide in the forums

1 : 2022-06-30
I haven't edited the code, got it straight from roguemaster GitHub. haven't seen anyone else with this issue which suggest to me it's not the code but something I'm doing wrong when compling.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Colon before = is most likely not supposed to be there or be a ! Hard to tell without the rest of the code. Also I'm no expert C programmer. I'm not the worst but definitely not the best.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
yeah, although I missed Kickstarter and pre-orders. this was a Lab401 order.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
What options have you tried? I have the best luck when using the "Read RAW" option and then setting the config there to make sure I'm seeing the signal correctly first.

Does the opener have and FCC ID anywhere on it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
UK here. Smashing F5 like I'm playing track and field.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
What was the est. date of arrival
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
You've already paid taxes on backerit, so the answer is no

Got my tracking email last week - still waiting for Evri to say that they have the delivery.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Will we have to pay for customs or is it included in shipping ? Anyone from Germany here ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Got my Tracking number yesterday. Shipping with DHL. I live in Germany. Will we have to pay for customs?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Definately not looking at the tracking number every 10 minutes (europe)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
My tracking has been saying, "Picked up by shipping partner, USPS Awaiting item." For the past 10 days 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Just got mine today i Waw So hyped up delivered in 3 day 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
sounds like an awesome idea! cant wait to see updates to this project
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Tracking says it will all arrive on the 10th, I will absolutely follow up ASAP!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Where are you? The UK?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
This is awesome. Gonna check out your firmware.
What got me into the flipper was just how much potential it had.

Keep it up man for the Nugs like us!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Take a crack at it and let us know how it goes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Thanks for the sub I appreciate it.

I agree it would be awesome to be able to control the dev board via the flipper especially if you can save the PCAPs to the SD card through the flipper.

I recently released firmware v0.9.9 which actually finds APs, deauths stations, and captures the handshakes. It's optional as well so you can opt out of sending deauths in a specific scan.

Yikes, that really stinks slashy!  On the other hand, I can somewhat understand that complex logistics are made slightly more complex by the political environment; maybe a Chinese-manufactured product from a Russian company is more difficult to move around these days?  I feel for the Flipper team; but trust me, it will have been worth the wait!

alright. )

1 : 2022-06-30
I mean I don't think it's possible ex-post, and I don't want to repost.
  Also, it's not like the parts I have blurred, have I blurred incorrectly. I have blurred them precisely as I meant to.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
No, I am a backer from germany and apparently we just have to wait longer for "logistics" reasons. 

So while US is already getting preorders EU backers are still waiting.

To top it off, they now decided to split the EU delivery in two batches but can't distinguish between backers who backed years ago and preorders who ordered months ago, so some preorders from the EU even get theirs before EU backers and they still think this is acceptable 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
do it, don't just say it ;)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
u/MuddledBox I was wondering this too - if you need help maintaining or debugging i'm sure many of us would like to help you out.   
Alternately, we could start a new project building plugins for the added features of the custom FW.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Btw don't blur things out. Paint them over and make sure there aren't any artifacts in the form of the letter outlines left. Blurred data can still be retrieved...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
I rather blur it out if i were you. safe side ;)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Did you ever get a tracking number?  Are you a US backer?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
There's no way anybody could claim it as they're checking our IDs here when delivering more expensive packages.

Other than that, as long as it doesn't show my exact address, it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
cool cool, mine hasn't shipped and I'm a backer... but don't worry, everyone will just tell me that it's fine...

1 : 2022-06-30
Same LT
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
Sure.  More of a vision than anything else.  I want to be able to send protocols, and maybe (long term) plugins from device to device without needing a computer.  Sort of like trading pokemon... if someone else has a flipper and you want to give them a new skill, you should be able to do it laterally.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-30
easyship was the sender but I already knew the tracking code via the order page. The 15th of June DHL notified me of a shipment which still isn't at DHL.

The only hard part here is somehow having obtained both devices... qFlipper app works cross-platform including on Linux, Steam Deck runs Linux... It all fits together nicely!

1 : 2022-06-29
I have 77 of the 320+ in my library are verified.  Some that aren't verified work good enough.  It's a solid gaming device, but I'm still not 100% used to the feel of it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Good to know. How are games on it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
I like mine and use it frequently, but don't count on being away from charging for long.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
It's made from the serial number!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Sorry doxxed isn't the right word. I'm not insinuating your flipper name is attached to your real identity. But the name is unique, when I hack the planet I don't want anybody to identify my flipper... Even if that name isn't attached to me anywhere. It's probably overly cautious, I was thinking of the Flipper's name like a fun MAC address
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
I got my tracking number today too!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Tell us more about the device to device. I have two and would like to know more
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Not doxxing the owner's identity, the flippers! I don't want people knowing my flipper's name! That's mah boy!

Incredible. Flipper should be here any day and well, the steam deck is a different story but do you have a guide on how you did this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
How do you like the steamdeck so far? I preordered whichever one is available later this year.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
And there's no way to match them to the owner, due to how our logistics work.

So, they're not doxing anyone, everything's fine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
How can you get doxxed from a Flipper name?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Yup mine has shipped too!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
This is a really, really useful and neat tool.  Its super small and has a really long battery life.  I may not have a reason to use it daily, but I find myself picking it up at least a few times a week for odd jobs.  The OS works a treat and is really friendly and fun to use.  So much potential for this beautifully designed open source device personally Id pick one up before they are banned in your country (kidding sort of)

Also, does this mean we're in the **first** part of the EU batch? Great!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
This IMO pretty much aligns with my estimations, actually!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
&gt; The first half of the EU batch is packed and is awaiting flight. Expected departure for it is on July 2nd. The second half of the EU batch is currently being packed.

Bro I was just scrolling on the sun and had some questions most of the time videos dont help gotta have a person say
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Sure
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
My flipper has shipped, got my steam deck 2 weeks ago, now I wait...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
oh, wish I'd knew... but since the tracking isn't really even available for me yet, it seems that it's just now been entered into the shipping company system. Let's take a wild guess here.. let's say it'll get expedited on the 1st of July... then it's weekend, then the actual shipping will take place, ... and depending on the customs, I'd say... since they seem to have good logistics, I could get it 7th July...? With customs interference, however... ugh... that can easily take up whole weeks up to a month... So hoping the customs have already been cleared for us, the EU members...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Whats time frame once u get that

You might not want to dox yourself. Flipper names are unique!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
Loved this OP.

I think if we can find a way to write some scripts so that you would control it from the Flipper screen it would be dope. Then have it save any results to the SD card and then pull them.off via bluetooth later.

Also interaction would be kool such as a modified version of something like wifilite2 where you would find, deauth, and then cap a few handshakes to be looked up later.

Love what you did here. Keep it up. I subbed your YouTube. Looking forward to seeing what you keep on doing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-29
I'm getting mine too !!! I'm so happy for all of us 
-------------------------------

does a steam deck count as EDC? I mean, i guess it would fit in your pocket if you have cargo pants.

1 : 2022-06-29
I tried to emulate my apartment card, I thought it didn't work at first, but when I tried multiple times, it actually worked. Maybe try again and again, it took me a good minute to get it work on the reader.

So my guess is that the emulation is not powerful enough to send the data in a reliable way, while the reader try to read what it has received (not the full sectors of data). Of course, I might be wrong as I am new to NFC/RFID technologies.
Also, sorry for digging out the topic, but wanted to add my input to this issue.

Pretty much. The flippers only role in this tbh is just a USB UART bridge. I want it to be able to offer the serial data over bluetooth though

Only 3 days to deliver through lab401? They really f*cked up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
It seems so ironic to me...

Backed? Pre-ordered? It doesn't matter... In the end the fastest way was to wait for lab401 

I don't want to sound salty, I'd just like to point out the irony of how it turned out...

Has yours been collected by Evri yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Or just a few sheet of aluminum foils or any surface of metal. It doesn't take much to block signals. Most RFID/NFC blocker are just a metal enclosure.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Interesting!! Definitely keep us posted on any findings.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Where are you based if you don't mind me asking?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
I'm guessing it's possible to use a blank card to make your own NFC blocker?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Ah, I see.  Since your post, I've been reading up on them online.  I had heard about NFC/RFID blocking cards but didn't give much credence to their actual performance.  I'll have to order a few and test them out.  Thanks for bringing this up!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
theres none using this. its its own card you place it between the card and reader to scramble attempts to steal data
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Interesting!  I have yet to come across one of these, but would be interested if there was an app for the Flipper that provided real-time data display to demonstrate this.  Do you know of any particular brand of access card or CC using this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
theyre all pretty much the same so rfid blocking card on amz
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Any links on where to get them? Like a reputable brand.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
scramble cards are the more common types, they send looping, random bits of nonsensical information, chopping up any attempt of communication between the reader and protected card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Hi guys and gals,

This is my new Flipper Zero saying hi!

Got it super fast luckily (3 days from Lab401) and am stoked with this fun little bit very functional device!

Have a nice day!
-------------------------------

Sorry, UK. I could be wrong. Turns out housemate has ordered a parcel too. :-| The anticipation is killing me!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
It says it can handle 128 gb, so I originally used that, but DONT. I put it in and the Flipper immediately started to over heat (and it was a SanDisk,  not a pos card.) I switched to the 32 and way more than enough room for anything

Dude its open source so things are constantly being developed by the community.
Itll clone a lot of hotel keycards, most rfid access cards, Amiibos, universal remote for anything, etc.

Have you tried the unlocked firmware? There are a lot more features and I dont know what you mean by useless in the US but if youre talking about frequencies, the cfw bypasses a lot of that.

The Bad USB feature is worth it alone. Rubber ducky stuff is fantastic.

More is being added constantly. Your imagination and the imagination of the community is the only limit.

If you only messed with it for a day, it makes sense why you dont like it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
What's wrong with asking questions? How else do you learn? Just Google the question first, but I'd you can't find an answer... Ask reddit.
-------------------------------

Youve gotta be more subtle man. Try just changing the channel at first. Otherwise youve just got a $200 TV-B-Gone
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Nope, I've never said a word about "full" knowledge. Nevertheless, I still hope OP will understand that they've ordered something much bigger than a mere toy you can just shoot questions on Reddit about.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
I see most of you didnt get the silicone case. Please be warned the Inferred and screen does get scratched up since its gorilla plastic. Suggest you buy a screen protector and cut out the small piece for the screen. If you want this part of your E.D.C

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Obviously not the way to, but that's not what you said in your comment. There you criticize OP because he bought a flipper without full knowledge.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
No problem, I agree that randomly asking around is exactly the way to go when learning to use a device like that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
This appears to be inaccurate. The site was last updated on [July 23rd](https://i.imgur.com/RojsJiP.png), while the Discord was [updated yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/olcK4Ih.png) with an estimate of July (h/t to u/C1ark05 for providing that information in this thread.

it is mentioned that is currently manufactured in late june and from discord, it is going to be ship on July.

What's your problem? Maybe OP wants to learn about RF and the flipper is a good place to start especially for the price.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Buddy, YouTube search "flipper zero"... 

Not trying to be rude, but it seems like you didn't even put in a little effort to search for documentation or existing videos.

PS. the best way to learn flipper is just by doing. Not knowing and learning is the best, and what I look forward most of all!
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
It's challenge-response, so you need to send the specific signal from the terminal to the card. You would be able to do it with what is essentially a repeater, by having a device near the card and near a terminal. But it would only work while you're close enough to the card. You can't just replay it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
What about relay attacks? Or more accurately, delayed one-time replay attack... Hmmm... It's likely timestamped though...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Uh, a physical credit card doesn't have an internet connection either and that still works. There's simply no way to get the required keys out of either a card or a phone. If there is (there has been in the past) that version of the technology will be quickly replaced and the key you got will stop working.

You can probably make a huge amount of money in bug bounties if you figure out how to do it, though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
The Google pay thing has some point tho, afaik it uses transaction tokens that are pre-generated, even, so it works without an internet connection.

Then it should, at least in theory, from my limited understanding, be possible to emulate the transaction with a token to appear as Gpay transaction.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
There are already videos on YT
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Don't let the troll get you down. Keep reading and asking questions. You can kind of see at as like getting an Arduino. Its a great tool to use as a learning tool. Check out the Discord channel for it and some of the unofficial firmwares. Those are places with lots of information.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
So you ordered a flipper without even knowing its intended use. Figures.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
There isn't one for the starting auction price from what I saw :0
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Yeah youd need either a glaring flaw, some kind of sca vuln, or an electron microscope and a million dollar team.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Oh, wow. 
It's like the doors inside the IC3 trains in Denmark.. they are so hard hard to open with brown hands.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
You literally cannot extract the encryption key needed to sign the transactions from the card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
You can its just illegal and you have to reverse engineer each card you want to add, since you cant get your flipper to be an issuer.


Although idea, I bet you could strip android down to everything that makes up a google pay transaction and emulate it. Youd need a network connection, shit ton of re, and itll probably take 5 minutes to run.

I think theres phones without a proper root of trust that can use google pay so its probably possible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Around the same backer number as you! But I believe it will arrive :-) It can't be many months now.

Well now I have something to slap onto one of those handy dev boards!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Yeah I see that one but I might just buy it at auction for like 250
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
There is one for sale for $650 CAD
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Yeah I found that after I posted this. I feel like an idiot lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Im not being entitled lol 1. The title was a joke obv Im not going to find one for less than retail and Im just finding someone willing to sell it at any price and 2. You really gotta calm the hell down
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
No, you can't use the flipper zero as a credit card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
I found one for 400 but idk if Im willing to spend that much for just a different color. I might just buy it for at least double the price at an auction instead of quadruple the price
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Yeah idk why tho, I been checking eBay and the only ones that arent auctions is this one asshole selling it for $800
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
There's not enough of these to go around and you're asking for less than retail price. If anything there would be sold at a markup, get a grip and stop being so entitled
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
I hate to let you down, but peeps are offering double the price elsewhere. Black Flippers are rare. Brace yourself for the flood of hecklers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Ill probably just get the black one on eBay because I cant find anywhere else that has black ones
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-28
Back as a Kickstarter Backer one could choose a color. I think it's not possible anymore

Having been in an ambulance for years, you know most cities photograph the vehicle using them, right?  And that it's a felony to impersonate an emergency vehicle?  And even in the cities that don't video record them directly with the opticom 2 system upwards still *do* record their usage and correlate them with intersection camera footage.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Awesome. Nice job.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
I got it. It was not the switch or the battery connector. I found a proper Phillips. Got the back off. The two screws in the mid board. The one down in the little plastic tube. Mind you I just removed 5 screws no issue. That one screw was in too tight. I stripped the head off. By now I realized the unit was powered on. I put the back on. It stayed on till I put my thumb on the center if the back cover. I did this 3 times. So I looked at the bottom board, and what was located in the center. Two ribbon cables, a narrow one and a wide one. When I touched the wide one , it went off and on. So I lifted the black plastic lock on the connector, pushed them in the ribbon cable, and locked it. No change. Then I looked for the other end of that ribbon cable. I was able to lift one end of the back board to see the connector on the middle board. I took a toothpick, lifted the lock, pushed in the ribbon cable and relocked the connector. Problem solved. I had a ticket open with the manufacturer. They came back , glad its fixed. I would have wound up sending it back to China if I hadnt been so persistent. So save this one in you notes.

Every time a bro's sink isn't registering I would be a damn magician. (but really I must be the only guy that spends a good minute at some sinks, soap dispensers, and paper towel dispensers/air dryers trying to get the perfect angle with my floppy hands..

Thank you! I'll start playing as soon as it arrives in the mail on the 10th of july :) sounds fun to me
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Hahaha my flipper broke help. But really, apparently auto-faucets, soap dispensers, and paper dispensers are harder to activate for people who aren't caucasian? Maybe that's why my idea seems so niche while all my life I think they've been singling me out. My bathroom breaks take longer, thats some crazy niche systemic disadvantage if the technology really does have a problem with melanin.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Auto sinks and paper dispensers absolutely hate me and me only apparently. (actually, reading up on it, it could be because they're more calibrated for Caucasians which gives this thought/project a very interesting accessibility twist)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Sounds fun! And yeah thank you haha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
haha maybe keep it on a lanyard, already preset, and press the button with my elbow? Not sure if it could work from my pocket. Also, for me it's more because auto-sinks and paper dispensers absolutely hate me.

Same here. Was advertised to have much more functionality. Im still waiting for arduino support.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
The difference is those people usually developed/made the thing and show a proof of concept, to illustrate how broken a system or process is. The recent Tesla hack for example. They did not release the code in a script kiddy complete fashion though. 

There is a way to do those things and asking blatantly on Reddit for the IR codes is not that.

I use mine everyday, mostly just to turn on the TVs at work. It keeps my dolphin buddy happy. I've also used it as a backup remote for the AC, when the actual remote was lost for a period of time. It's also fun scanning various NFCs.

The thought of this absolutely excites me.  


The way I am too stupid to be able to code it though makes me sad.

Of course, and I'll never say wasting water is a good thing. Mischief is mischief though. A tiny bit of controlled chaos along the way.

I used to have a TV-B-Gone that would shut down TVs. That could be viewed as a benefit to humanity. Turning on water faucets just wastes fresh water, which we need.

I see the potential for mischief, more than practicality.

Though turning them off/on while not about to wash your hands was my initial thought. Harmless trickery, so to speak.

All good points.

I would add, you should as a courtesy and common sense, ask whoever provisions access at work before you use this there.  It's not particularly unethical or even an access violation, but it is sort of rude and weird.  Like what you said, it's a bit like making a copy of a borrowed key.

Also some businesses will take security pretty seriously, especially if they are trying to be PCI compliant or similar.
-------------------------------

If you want a configuration that you can set up and forget about, then yes, but as you said, it's the learning part that kills you. I've found that making small changes to configurations works best.

Just hold the flipper where you would place your hands. SO SIMPLE! Just know it will get wet and you'll need to be okay with that.

I think you have your mission set out for you.  Try and see what happens, but be careful, although it is a flipper with a dolphin character on it, it isn't waterproof :)

Walk me through this.

1. You have filthy hands.
2. Instead of waving them below the faucet, you reach into your pocket and push buttons on your Flipper.
3. Now you have a filthy Flipper.
4. You put the filthy Flipper back in your pocket so you can wash your hands.
5. Now you have a filthy pocket.

I'm missing the benefit.

Personally, I find it pretty fulfilling to mess with Tesla owners' charge ports, but I bought this thing knowing that there's so much more I can do with it, I just haven't had time to sit down and sink my teeth into it yet.

1 : 2022-06-27
Factual, but also how much control of that do you really have?

rfid for entry control in appartment building is basically a given nowadays, but as a renter and even as an owner what can you realistically do about it? You could petition the owner's association but people don't actually care that much.

Same thing for opening the door to work, unless you work with an IT firm that takes security seriously, telling your boss "security is bad" will get you nowhere. This is precisely why you're able to get a 200$ device that serves as a pentest tool.

In that way, these devices are good teaching tools ("see how easy it is?"), but eventually it just ends up teaching you that you cannot actually depend on these systems for security.

Also in that mix is the fact that op has free access to the rfid tags that they cloned, and that's straight up not the kind of attack surface these systems are prepared for. This is like saying "i cut a copy of my home key and use it everyday". Sure, someone with resources is able to do the same without complete free access, but the fact you had access is actually important

Backers have the privilege of receiving their rewards if the project gets successfully funded and creators have the obligation of delivering rewards always in good faith. Things might not get through there course of the expected plan, but theres an obligation of going last mile if needed to deliver rewards to backers.

Even though that is part of Kickstarter accountability section, seems like you still disagree here, and youre also being disrespectful, so will not respond further.

Depending on the age and quality of the machine this could be very difficult in that the sensor system may have error correction or operate at very specific frequencies.   I say this not to discourage you but to encourage you to start with older or cheaper machines so that hopefully you'll have some initial success and move forward from there.

Backer #2502, still waiting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
&gt; they could have prioritized backers over pre orders

BACKERS ARE NOT PRIVILEGED. KICKSTARTER IS NOT A STORE, AND YOU AREN'T PAYING FOR A POSITION IN A QUEUE. STOP INSISTING OTHERWISE.

You keep saying this and its bullshit. There's only a *tiny* number of units that have gone to non-backers, and the only way to satisfy you would have been to spend money to keep them embargoed in a warehouse until well after every single EU backer's tracking number had been marked as delivered. Because they were programmed as US units, and CAN NOT be sent to EU backers. Even if that wasn't true, the rest of the EU shipment had to be completed anyway - again, the number of devices you are complaining about is TINY.

Godspeed on your tinkering good Redditor 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Sorry but then lets agree to disagree. I think youre wrong, they fucked up in two things:
- they could have prioritized backers over pre orders, and still have the same exact batches and operating costs - this would have reduced the frustration from backers, since whoever pre ordered is receiving the item and youre not.
- their official distributor had their product even before the first batch, which makes backers totally irrelevant. - If I knew things were going to be like this, Id not have back it up. I paid the same exact amount as if I ordered it from lab401, and lab401 would have it faster shipped to me. As Im a backer that was left for the second EU wave, Ill need to wait till end of July (or more, lets see how it goes)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
Not all use infrared, some use some kind of ultrasonic sound and calculate the distance by timing the return time and divide (multiply,subtract?, I'm not 100% sure) by speed of sound/light/whatever. Unless its a smart one, they don't actually use any signals like a remote control would.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-27
It does this with my garage door opener. Example: use the flipper 3 times, then, push button on OG remote, nothing, push second, nothing, and a third time, nothing. Then on the 4th push itll open. I assume there is an algorithm that changes the code by the same variable with each cycle. Use the flipper x# of times, the OG remote would then need to be cycled x# +1. Is this dumbed down explanation accurate as to how that functions? If so, how do the other OG remotes know what sequence is next, especially with a vehicle being well out of communication range of the other keys as often as they are?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Yes, and it's irrelevant. Demanding something that's not only not promised but is also physically impossible is downright stupid.

The official information says anything over 32GB is a waste for most any user. It has even been said in the official Discord that 4GB is plenty for most. 512 would be absurd, dont waste your money.

it's just text files bro. basically need about 550MB
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I feel like somebody needs to say... 

If the Flipper Zero is this useful to you as a normal part of your daily security, then the systems you depend on for security are really insecure.

I see it as a cool way to acquire knowledge about how secure things are, but the idea of using it as an actual daily key seems kinda nuts to me, you should be trying to upgrade the security instead.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I use mine multiple times a week.  There are quite a few more things to do than pop a Tesla charge door open.  The device's capabilities are constantly being improved, so sit tight while others create add-ons/capabilities or do it yourself.  It's just like any other hack tool, it's up to you to figure out how to use it and then what you want to do with it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Havent really touched it since a couple days after I got it.  Have zero interest in playing with electronic gas doors. What I need to do is go play with the unlocked firmware. 

I did dupe a few remotes and things, but nothing daily. It also couldnt see the nfc keycard my buddy uses to get into his building. Very cool platform, no regrets.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I'm the same with you. 

I've got it connected to my garage door.
It's my work badge
It's my parking garage pass.
I also got my local transit pass with it.
I use it for my TV
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Sorry can I just copy the file by itself or does or do i have to flash whole firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
It may be overkill but at least you never have to worry about it slowing down or filling up and 32gb (what the devs recommend) is extremely cheap and easy to buy. So if you think about it is it really that overkill?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you. That's basically what I plan on doing.  Figure out what I can get it to do on my own, and maybe see if I can figure out how others do it.  Maybe troll someone along the way.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
There's no wrong place to start! Goodness knows my hackish python/micropython probably won't be much use here, but it's on my list. 

When in doubt, just play to see how things work! If that card doesn't clone, why? How does the protocol work? That's my general life philosophy, at least :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you. I'll make sure I do that before I troll friends
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Honestly it varies; rolling codes arent a new thing and youll find them on 00 cars but even modern cars now dont all have rolling codes. Youd have to look up each car and see what their fcc records says
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Is this something used much with older cars?  Most of the people I know are currently using early 00 vehicles
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Yes, there is something called rolling code. Rolling codes usually requires something called a seed to know where to begin the sequence of changing codes. Once a code has been used, its marked as used and move onto the next one. An improperly copied key will act as the originally key, but on the next use, either flipper or the original key will get out of sync with the vehicle.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you for your advice. I wasn't aware it could cause sync issues, I hadn't seen that issue.  I'll look into it more, before I do anything
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you, I saw that. I'm also aware you can occasionally go bigger.  If I always followed recommendations I would have a working 512 GB sd card in my 3DS, so I can save all my games to it. I was asking to see what would be practical
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Ah I did indeed misread but what I said about gaming coming to flipper is true still. 

As far as coding goes, this is not a good way to learn. Flipper is a lot of things but a coding or practice tool it is not. Currently, you cant really write scripts even. Everything has to be compiled and baked into the firmware and upload. Even eventually, iirc itll take only C code. There are plenty of other better tools out there for that. 

If youre interested in penetration testing, then the flipper could be more applicable. 

All the usages youve listed is certainly doable. Be careful with copying keys. Its possible to lock your friends key and desync it from the car with no easy way of resyncing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I think you misunderstood. I meant Im use to buying SD cards for my 3DS, switch, laptop and so on. Im use to seeing things be measured in gigs. I dont have much experience in coding, as I didn't need it a lot.   I intend to use this as a way to help learn about it, and maybe do a few trolls in ways that wouldn't matter. Flipping channels at restaurants, opening tesla charging ports, changing the TV channels at Walmart.  Maybe try and freak some friends out by copying their key fobs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
official site recommended 16gb max
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Scripts are text files. Theyre small unless you have some really inefficient coding or you love to comment a lot of your code
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Games? Games wont be able to come to flipper properly for a few quarters. Plus youre also restricted in the fact that flipper doesnt have a traditional cpu or gpu. The games are going to be more 8bit in nature which are small to
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Oh well. If I do end up writing a PC script maybe itll just be something quick for people who forget to lock their computer at work. Something stupid that would get a laugh form those Im on good terms with
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I think right now they don't have a formal filesystem that you can mount - all the management I've done was through the qflipper app. However, I can't imagine this would be impossible - it already emulates HID for badusb.

The only other impediment is that it's read/write speed isn't super hot due to using SPI for power savings. That might mean using as a drive may be a bit sluggish...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you. I wasnt aware it used smaller file sizes. Im use to files being gigs, not MB/KB.
-------------------------------

Thats extreme overkill for a recommendation"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
You will literally never fill up an 8gb card bro, lmfao
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Huh, I didnt know that was possible with the flipper.  I dont do much with random computers, just my gaming laptop. I have been playing with the idea to write some simple scrips I can use while Im gaming. Im still new to to things like this, so not sure what all is and isnt possible
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Something like that. Could make a nice carry for emergency ISOs and such (have a boot image selection menu on the flipper, etc).  I have a 32 gig flash on my Keyport that does the same thing right now.
-------------------------------

I personally am using a 256GB microSD. No issues, full size is detected by the device. 

You definitely don't need that much space considering the size of most files. I personally do store some things on the MicroSD to use directly with a PC though. (Tools, scripts, etc)

From experience, something small and flipper-sized is probably three hours tops, two hours if the printer is cheap and tuned, an hour if it's a nice printer and maintained by someone who cares, or four or five hours if it's An Printer maintained by librarians trying their hardest (which I respect, public resources are important!) without knowing the ins and outs.

1 : 2022-06-26
Are you sure you have a correct modulation selected?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thank you for your answer. I used the last unleashed version because of EU restrictions with frequencies. I will retry with an official fw.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Its not. It is result of compromises on multiple levels. For antenna to work in such wide range we sacrificed its gain. And RC config is also uses optimization for bandwidth, not selectivity. If you know exactly what you receiving you can patch radio config to match the signal.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
The frequency analyzer has a very low sensitivity to filter out any noise, that's intended.

However, it seems that you are using a custom firmware fork, as we do not have a spectrum analyzer in the official fw. You'll need to either flash the official firmware (as some forks are known to be buggy and unstable) and retry, or contact your fork's developers for support.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I read in 868.35 MHz. When I used frequency analyzer it didn't work for the remote so i used spectrum analyzer and the frequency is 868.349 MHz. When i rec the signal is displayed on the screen.The frequency analyzer work with the door when i open it but i have to be very close to the transmitter. I don't know if it's an hardware issue.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
What frequency are you reading on? What frequency does the frequency analyzer show when you activate the remote?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
One use case for larger sizes would be if you wanted to use it like a flash drive, but I haven't seen a lot of push for that feature.

This guy gets it, and quite frankly I'm surprised at all the downvotes. If knowledge was restricted because of what it *might* do, being a maker/hacker quite literally wouldn't be a thing.

Shame to see it

1 : 2022-06-26
I use my flipper everyday. It has replaced all my sub ghz devices like light switches fan switches. Its my garage door opener now. I use it to get into work place. Its a back up for parents garage and gate opener. Its a cool little device I love mine. Its definitively a edc for me.

Ah bummer, it's with the many stuff i buy that just gets lost and i rarely use. Thanks for telling me!

Yeah there's some 3-D printed solutions out there, someone made a really nice enclosure for the ESP32 board &amp; I know there's a few printed cases for the flipper I've seen posts for too on this sub

Also, don't forget that if you have a local library there's a good chance they have a 3D printer you can basically rent out or pay per print for.

Most of them are between a few bytes and a few kilobytes

The maximum it can handle is 128gb but the recommend 32gb
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Wrong. Kickstarter is extremely explicit in that it is only a way for people to support creators. It is not a store, you are not buying ANYTHING, and getting a reward is not guaranteed - it can come late, not as originally described, or not at all.

"Other people getting it before backers" is *exactly the same complaint*.

Pretty much the smallest microSD card you can find will do you with plenty of capacity left over
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Max supported size according to their documentation is 128GB, however their documentation also suggests a capacity of 64GB, or 32GB.

Talked with some people that already have theirs on the flipperzero discord about it, sounds like people are using the range of sizes up to the 128GB max. capacity without any issue.

Im use to buying storage for games.  Thats amazing. I cant wait to see what all I can do with it

1 : 2022-06-26
Yeeesh... someone is unfamiliar with how heavily restricted/censored most dangerous information is.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
One kilobyte can fit like 200 human words assuming an average of like 4 characters and one space between them. Vague example, but kilobytes and megabytes are much larger than people think. I would be shocked if the Flipper would ever generate a &gt;1GB file no matter what it was doing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Awesome, thanks 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Yes, it matters, but you can reformat the SD cart with the flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Thats forking awesome, thanks. Does format matter?  I have a old one from my 3DS thats fat32 formatted
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26

I think the problems we are seeing is actually tied with the management of the shipping phase. If theyre trying to push pre orders / encounter official distributors in order to increase their sales so they can raise more capital to solve a need, Id prefer transparency on that from the management team to the backers. But the way all this is playing out seems just less transparent. They also didnt disclose the reasoning on why the EU wave got split, and they kinda thrown the packaging for other countries in between (Russian wave and the US devices), which I believe was the reason to slow down the EU delivery. I understand that there are reasons behind decisions, and that theyre trying their best, but Im convinced they werent transparent nor diligent in this matter. Honestly, Id prefer to develop and charge for the plugins at this point, either that or sell the flipper, because I just lost faith in the community
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
I get that, but Id like to encourage you to do so either way  - if we want to change the tone in the community we have to do our part. I feel like a large part of the current mood we can observe, for example in this sub, comes from a bad management of the shipping situation from the kickstarter 

I get that kickstarter as a platform allows great products and ideas to become real but I also see many problems with the concept
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-26
Its so sad that, I was planning to build some cool functionalities for the firmware, now I dont want at all to do that specially to a community where expressing frustration on a healthy way results in such down pushing even tho theres a lot of backers feeling the exact same. Its sad.

Think of a jukebox but it plays music through Spotify.  Bars and restaurants have physical stations where users can queue up songs to be played for a small charge. It streams the song off of whatever catalog they use and plays it through speakers in the restaurant. Personally I don't see the point. Jukeboxes made sense when being able to play music on-demand was a novel concept, but nowadays everyone has the exact same service on them at all times.

&gt; happened! We *paid* for a

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

True words right there. So many ungrateful people. When I think about it. I probably didn't need my 'toy' as much. It probably could of gone to something greater.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-25
No one even mentioned backer count order/sorting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-25
Deliveries in backer count order is not a promise any kickstarter ever makes. Stop treating KS like a store, there are no guarantees of delivery at all,  let alone schedule,  and you shouldn't have backed if you demand otherwise.

I truly apologize most of EU havent got there FlipperZero yet and most are already out on tiktok / Reddit/ hacking community channels already showing off what it can do. Please keep in mind, a lot of people didnt know about this til late . I was and fortunate to get mine due to purchasing it with early bird. Please understand EU and Asia still has the worst influx ever. Also, there are a lot of crap going on outside the world besides a hackagotchi toy. There is homeless / refugees/ war / poverty/ economic recession. Not everyone is fortune to own or buy one. Most, of you have kids. Trust. Being from USA is hard AF. Dont get me wrong, it can do a lot of great things and bad things. 

I leave with these quotes.

With great power comes great responsibility - Ben Parker 

You cant always get what you want, if try sometimes. You might just find what you need. - Rolling Stones

"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." From Hacker - Cereal Killer and Corinthians 13:11.

What I am saying is who cares, when you get it you get it. It will be like Christmas morning when you were 10 and all you want to do is open your present or just fucking live and breath. Be glad you have a job/ money/ roof over your head over a $100 electronic toy.

Yeah, it's always fun when someone who already got what they paid for already (for several months even) tells other people to shut up when they just want the same. Such a logical and empathic point to make.

Also: "you need testosterone" &amp; "man up" ... you're projecting, and by a lot. Feeling a little insecure, eh? That's probably why you resort to personal attacks. But don't worry, you still can get help. Someday you might even have a discussion based on ... well, actual points.

It doesn't matter if it's a hobby item or not. I paid for it. More so I helped bring it to production (and it reached production, so that "Kickstarter isn't buying" just doesn't count anymore), so that people could even preorder it to begin with. Why should I then, wait longer than those who just ordered one?

But trying to attack me personally because I don't agree with you, say a lot about you 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-25
I understand thanks for the answer!

If you ordered on Shopify - the track for the first wave can be seen on your order page, but we haven't yet sent out the e-mail with it. And on backerkit the tracking info for the first wave has not been loaded yet.   


Please be patient, we're doing our best to do this as quick as possible.

If we live in eu and have not received our tracking link yet, does this mean we are in wave 2? Has everyone in wave one received their tracking number?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-25
It doesn't. Even some people who preordered in the last few month in EU will receive theirs before backers. That has nothing to do with regulations but all with bad decisions.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-25
So the "geopolitical situation" is the reason why people who bought one in May (US) already getting theirs in the next few days while EU has to wait till next month to even get their BACKED products (and this doesn't even include that some with preorders in EU even get theirs before backers). Sure!   


Today I learned that effed up priorizitation is obviously a "geopolitical situation".

Q: Where are the sources? I want to write a dark-mode theme and publish the jailbreak as my own.  
A: checkra1n is released in binary form only at this stage. We plan to open-source later in 2020. We will release the full checkra1n source once we have a Windows GUI version. We had hoped to get there in 2020, but we didn't manage to. But PongoOS, the kernel patchfinder and the SEP exploit are already open source on GitHub.  


Is this enough or a matter of waiting on full source?

I just bought a flipper from lab401, their official distributor in Europe. Shipped out today Ill have it in a week. Check them out if you dont want to buy off eBay. Its in euros but still cheaper than the $600 price tags Ive been seeing on eBay. Just checked. Still in stock. Good luck!

I have access to some cool tools right now, my own personal project is becoming overwhelming, and this sounds cool.

I just need you to tell me some of the science and I can run this through actual AI (GPT-3) and see what it can do with it.
I am sure the devs would enjoy their AI learning music production.
Even debugging the code takes seconds.
Can also convert the code to Java effortlessly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
I agree. I understand the trouble and complexity behind the logistics. 

Totally agree that the flipper team has done an amazing work to bring the device. Its just that all the messages a delays makes it feel a bit as it was left out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
I feel like the exact same.

Ok, it's understandable that they want to minimize shipping costs by making bulk shipment, but still..... I was an early backer (that got lucky to get the minimal price) and lots of people that ordered later got them already.

I won't shoot on the flipper team. Not their intent to make people wait, but I'm really looking forward my toy!

I think you are on to something there! Audio FSK modulation was made for FM in the audio range. It would be relatively slow for data transfer, but would totally work. Would it be practical? Probably not, lol. But it is possible!

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
my point exactly. The UK are outside the EU, yet shipping is, bafflingly, combined. Norway, though outside EU, is part of the EEC.  Explanations have varied from regulatory issues to logistics partner doesnt offer the option. Regulations are the same, and any halfway competent logistics partner should be able to do shipping to all of the EEC.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
Please decide. Is it a regulatory issue - and if so, what exactly is the issue - or is it an issue to do with your logistics partner?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
No, they are included in the EU &amp; UK batch.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
...except for the fact that the UK is - quite famously - also not a member of the EU, but their orders ARE included in the EU batch.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
I don't know all of the details, but our logistics provider has a delivery option to all EU countries at once, which we use. 

Norway only has 368 orders, which is not enough to send a separate delivery plane, so it is grouped with the rest of the world, where the logistics will be differently structured to account for small batches.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
That's a whole bunch of assumptions you have there. The work I had to do was nobody's fault, just a reality when complex projects come up against part and labour constraints. Same for the delays you face - I've had to wait just as long, but the difference is I know how difficult what they're doing is. You *don't* successfully deliver tens of thousands of devices without being extremely competent in the first place.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
You cared enough to respond.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
The US shipment has nothing to do with the EU batch being split into two separate waves, Im not sure where you are getting this from.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
It never got bumped to rest of the world, it is not part of the European Union which is the criteria for being part of the EU batch.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
i feel being left out. People pre-order this thing getting it before backers who backed WAY and WAY earlier.

&gt;u/astrrra  
&gt;  
&gt;: I'd appreciate an answer as to what laws and regulations you believe warrant this split.

Repeating this, and once more tagging u/astrrra. As previously stated, Norwegian laws and regulations are generally harmonized with EU laws and regulations, although one would need to pay applicable taxes on import.   


If I understand the [information given in February of 2021](https://blog.flipperzero.one/explaining-shipping-and-taxes/) correctly, you and your transportation partners have opted not to avail yourselves of the VOEC option to collect VAT from customers prior to transport. As such, the last mile transportation partner would need to handle importation fees and charge the recipient directly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
Look, you entitled little b. I backed on Kickstarter the project more than ago. The other day, I saw someone's comment saying that they ordered the flipper 1 month ago, and they finally have it at home. I still don't. After 1 year and 4 months, I'm still waiting for it. 

People has the right to be mad about not getting "THEIR TOY", same as you have yours to be mad for working extra hours, but man, that's not my fault, nor this guy's, it's your boss's because they don't know how to plan, and much less, work into fast solutions when a problem happens, also, for not having backup workers so you don't have to eat a thousand hours shift.

It's illegal for them to send US programmed units to the EU, they're in different ITU zones and the permitted frequency ranges are different. 

But hey, obviously they're just rolling about in their supposed piles of money dreaming up ways to fuck you over, right? It couldn't possibly be because shipping anything globally is a fucking nightmare and for once you have to wait for physical reality to get your new toy.
-------------------------------

Youre really rude.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
Oh go jump. You obviously have *zero* understanding of how hard it is to get hardware designed, manufactured and shipped. There is no such thing as an accurate estimate, and that's before the global part supply and shipping crises hit.

Literally the last update they've given has been within the last week, but nothing they can do short of somehow magically teleporting a device into YOUR SPECIFIC HANDS two months ago is going to satisfy you.

I personally work in the hardware industry, and I also personally spent the last two weeks straight including weekends and nights working to get a production process sorted. That included at least one 30-hour shift. If you came up to me today and claimed I was doing a bad job just because you didn't have their fucking TOY delivered already I would have stabbed you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
I'm not aware of a delay compared to UK, and the US units apparently have to meet different regulatory standards. It seems, however, that Norwegian backers are begin seriously shafted.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
Youre not right at all fella. It is true that it may cause burn out in the team, but the bad management of the process and expectations is on them. It was wonderful to see them being transparent during the development process, which allowed us to be comprehensive, and setting undefined expectations allowed them to have a really eager community. Whats happening now is related with the pivoting of that strategy. The estimates set by then are WAY OFF, and to make it worse, the lack of care with backers is just raising frustration at a really rapid pace.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-24
Id say all the backers are being left out. EU was only shipped a piece of tb e orders and it seems like theyve not prioritized the backers. The word with that is that theyve also decided to ship a supposed returned cargo (that came from the factory) to the US at the same time of the UK wave, and now decided to ship the Russian wave at the same time as EU wave. Id say that all this management is just nuts. Im really feeling bad for the backers that are based on what they consider other countries

No, you're another of the constant stream of complainers who come through the discord server on the daily, refusing to read any of the updates or the response to exactly the same damn questions that happened five minutes earlier.

It does nothing to speed up the production process and just burns out everyone there who is trying to be helpful.

Thanks for your advice! Im still looking for one lol

Ugh, I'm really hoping to not have to try and take it apart.  I tried taking it apart and one of the screws got stripped so I'm extremely hesitant about taking it apart further.

Kind of concerned this is a common manufacturing defect....really hope I can get it replaced or fixed by manufacturer or something.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
Thanks, they sent me a repair guide, but I'd really honestly prefer an RMA as I don't want to potentially risk damaging it taking it apart myself.

I never said that it would make sense to sort backers by their order numbers, for me, backers are a whole group. What would make sense is to ensure that no pre order for a certain region gets their deliverables ahead of the backers, so that would be either backers before preorders or backers at the same time as preorders in the last bundles. The amount of work youre referring to in order to achieve this is zero. Your orders database is separate, you have the backers database and the website orders. Its already separated, would make sense to get all the EU backers in the first EU wave, fill the wave limit, and if needed, add some preorders or if theres more backers than the limit, put these at the second EU wave with the preorders. It does **not** require any extra work. You actually assumed that I was meaning sorting by backer order number and thats **not** my point.

Was Malta included? I didnt get any notification we are in EU
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
I understand your frustration. I personally speak with the people who manage our logistics and try to relay all the feedback from you to them and make this process as fair as possible, but some things we just can't be changed and other are really difficult to change (for example, there is just no way to sort backers by their numbers in our logistics software, so we can't send order sequentially (not without a tremendous amount of manual labor or extra delays caused by changing logistics software). I honestly wish we could do this in a better way (and try to improve the situation as much as I can).

The second EU part will be packed **before** the Russian batch. 

The changes in responses is me relaying the most up-to-date info that I have.

Day ruined 

( 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
Still, even after a lot of backers complaining about feeling left out/frustrated, you never addressed the fact you included the preorders randomly with backers, which increases the frustration over time. Honestly, it personally got me in such a bad mood that I dont even feel like I want to continue to be part of the community (I havent yet received the device so at this point Im only part of the community as a backer .
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
No, youre not starting the packing, you WILL start packing once you finish the 1k US targeted devices you guys decided to ship AHEAD of the EU backers. And could you also answer this: are you going to ship the second EU part before or after the Russian packing? From what Ive seen, youre changing the details in between responses, youve said earlier next week then next two weeks and now youre saying coming days

u/astrrra: I'd appreciate an answer as to what laws and regulations you believe warrant this split.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
So what you're saying is that you randomly let people skip the line infront of those who actually helped you bring this to life? 

I'm sure someone will tell me now not to be an entitled ass .... but sorry, wtf? I really don't care about how significant that time difference is, this just feels really weird. EU is behind NA/CA/AU by up to 2 months. So while we get to see others doing all the fun stuff with it already and patiently waiting. Now even those that ordered months later get theirs before, first in NA (as depicted by another post here where people who ordered in MAY got their shipping label) and now even EU.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
The shipment was indeed randomly split into two parts. However, we're already starting the packing of the other batch in the coming days, so there won't be a significant time difference between the first and the second half. You can follow https://ship.flipp.dev for live updates.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-23
I don't have a tracking number either (germany) and I am a backer. Is this true /u/astrrra? If so I am genuinely disappointed in how this is handled. It's not like EU is already pretty late while NA already gets preorders and even returned orders sent out and have received theirs... while we still wait.

Those are the ones. They can communicate with remotes on SubGHz but they use pins, most are allegedly just the default 000 tho. I downloaded a repo with a bunch of folders for different pins with signals for all the remote buttons in each folder but haven't played with it too much/gotten it working yet.

I also saw some comments on here about a brute force remote (like the TV IR one) in one of the custom firmwares but haven't checked it out either

A lot of backers are actually complaining because it seems theyre just getting left out. The Uk/eu orders has been split in two and a lot of preorders that were made like a couple of months ago were included in the first EU batch and the backers werent. And theres not any excuse for that because there were at least 4 german backers that didnt received the tracking code, but 2 german preorders did receive it. It says a lot about their care on the backers, the ones that supported the business when they had only simple prototypes.

Those are the types I'd look for, something weird about purchasing the right to buy something, and some have even scammed by selling simply their spot in line for $350, then you still have to pay upwards of $100 to actually get the flipper.

NFC Amiibos,

I'm using Bad USB to automate a few things. Have some macro's set up that do tedious work, but havent found a good program that does everything and allow free unlimited repetitions so it's acting as a keyboard pressing the hotkey after a timed delay.

As does the UK, though. I have backed a number of technology-related projects, none of which has needed to split orders bound for Norway from those bound for EU. Norway's regulations on telecommunications are a one to one match with EU regulations. All that remains is VAT and import tariffs, which it seems you have opted not to collect, instead leaving that to the shipping company and the customers.

making games.

While I get a grasp on the api, just been fixing/editing existing games. Added music, next piece display, in-game line and score counter, and a pause menu to tetris. Now I'm fixing flappy bird to actually have a lose condition (collision doesn't seem to work)  


magnum opus: flipparia (incredibly simplified terraria on flipper), with a dolphin pet follower that acts different depending on your flipper mood/level (maybe the game also affects these stats)

Mine was maxing at 8% but saying CHARGED.
I powered down, removed the case, unplugged battery &amp; protected those connectors, then did some stupid lucky ish with some shaky business and some minimal air movement business to delete some metal shavings that worked their way in there (this was likely my fault). 
Maybe not the recommended remedy, but it solved my issue. 
Take this like salt grains and do your best to fix and not brick the thing.

I like to go the bars/clubs district on weekends and turn off all the TV's at each bar/club :) Also pop all the Teslas I can find
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-22
It's the main security on things like car keys and other  radio remotes. Basically an algorithm comes up with a code and the algorithm is the same in both the car and the key fob. As soon as the code gets used, both the remote and car change the code so the code never stays the same. This is a very rough explanation so here's a [video](https://youtu.be/5CsD8I396wo) on the topic

U2F, fuckin with teslas, playing around the badusb just for fun/testing purposes right now, turning on this TV at work that constantly turns itself off for no reason, storing the 3 rfid tags I need for work in one place, using the spectrum analyzer just to kinda look at stuff see what frequencies are floating around in different places.

TV remotes, TV "fun", copying various NFC and RFID cards I use. Tesla "fun" :D Touchtunes testing (I actually work on touchtunes jukes!) Reading signals off of various remotes I have. 

Haven't messed much with ibutton or badusb, I do have some ibuttons, and a USB reader, but no locks or other devices that use them. I've played with the basic badusb scripts, and may try my hand at making some harmless prank ones. Haven't done much with the GPIO, but I may find something to tinker with.

Sub-GHz transmitter for ceiling fan, Tesla charge doors, and handicap doors. Just learned my lawn sprinkler system uses  RF, so I may play around with that.

RFID have a key fob copied on there.

NFC have a badge for opening doors, and can use it to send a mobile device to a domain if the mobile device is scanning for NFC.

BadUSB - got the Jacoby payloads on there along with some others

Making my own plug in modules for the gpio like relay control etc for hacking some high-power stuff. Maybe as simple as turning an appliance off and on when i want it to (as an apropos thing, not instead of something proper. Like if you suddenly need to turn something on and off by Bluetooth or accordingly to some input. Also other sensors eg a PIR sensor. When movement is detected, then emit this IR code or emulate this tag.

Thank you! I was really worried I was going to end up matching the colour of the pin labels and not be able to take it any further, then end up unable to read the label text.. but I'm really happy with the way the case kept getting darker and the pin labels didn't take up any of the dye.

Pen testing isn't the same as stealing a car. One has corporate and career-driven value and the other is for personal gain.

In all fairness, the OPs post isn't directly telling people how to steal nor is it providing materials so consider my comment a little overexaggerated and I apologise for that.

Nonetheless, exploits like this should be reported to the relevant manufacturers and the community should not be involved or endorsing the spread of materials that would directly educate or provide the means to actually commit crimes.

You definitely can get them in Australia, but I got mine through the Kickstarter. I've heard that some more stock should be going up soon, but they're still trying to get all the backlogged units out. I have no idea if that stock will be available internationally though. I think the restocks are currently US only.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-21
The tracking link directly off Shopify lists a July 11th. Its coming from Tennessee so I doubt it will take more than a week to reach anywhere in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Interesting, mine doesn't have a date estimate yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Mine estimates a July 11 delivery .
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Not sure how long it will take to get into USPS hands but it should be anywhere within the continental US in three days after that point.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Same here!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
FWIW: I was at a hotel last week and for the first time ever got 32/32 keys in the wild and was actually able to replicate my room key with the flipper. Unlocked the door no problem.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Yeah, US. USPS is our national mail service
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Where are you from? US?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Unless there has been an update, it still won't emulate it using this info.  I've been through a few revisions and extracted all 32 keys, once extracted and saved, there is no emulate option for the saved card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
This means that the flipper has successfully read the whole tag! That's quite uncommon in the wild, so congrats. You can now open the file on your computer and see the data that it contains
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Mifare classic - MFC - is pretty simple and old technology that has cracked cryptography.

Generally, it has some amount of memory to store data, keys that are used to access the data, and access rights for the specific keys...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Yeah just wait man. I was a Kickstarter  backer and I got mine like a 2 weeks ago. The wait is worth it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
https://blog.flipperzero.one/rfid/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Mine scanned as mifare classic, then the compatible apps scan did a total keys found: 32/32 A keys: 16 B keys: 16
Is there an easy explanation for whats happening here? Hadnt seen that before from a few other random NFC scans.
Didnt get around to trying to emulate to see if it would let me in, missed opportunity
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
^this
Most of these chips (anything a little more secure) cannot be cloned. The chip is intelligent (e.g. makes challange reaponse) and not just a number.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
That certainly seems like the sort of thing you might use it for, but if OP is looking for something more turnkey, I don't believe the dev board is that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
I got mine up and running (at least I think) and......that's about the furthest I've gotten so far with it. Don't feel bad, your not the only one having issues with em RN 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Just to set expectations: NFC is a family of protocols and formats, so first you need to determine if the Flipper supports whatever the festival is using.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
I now have a usps tracking number. So I imagine this week it will be here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
Yeah but the bar I work at was busy so I only got the most used commands. I could get the whole remote but it seemed like a waste of time. power, skip, volume, play and pause.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
The ip I think
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
What numbers are you referring to?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
The code for the U2F app is in the /applications/u2f/ in our firmware repository, you can take a look at it yourself. We consider it secure enough that the most probable attack vector is not finding the keys, but flashing the device with a custom firmware that decrypts everything via the crypto-enclave (as it stores all the keys and has the ability to encrypt/decrypt data on command, while the keys themselves are non-extractable).

You can add you own key to the 11th slot of the crypto-enclave via our crypto CLI interface to use that as your encryption key.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-20
After it tells me to connect to black magic and find those numbers it does et tell me where to look and Im on mac

Its only intended for debugging and programming purposes. You can read about it in the docs. 

https://docs.flipperzero.one/gpio-and-modules/wifi-debugger-module

1 : 2022-06-19
What can you do with the Juke if you have the remote? Full control?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-19
How is the key/s generated?

Memories of debian generating weak keys for like half a year if the OS was set up wrong kinda worry me, so I'd like to know if its possible to go through the process of setting up the u2f stuff from scratch using keys I've generated on my computer for example
-------------------------------

Try looking for the fcc id that should be on the fob. They will list the frequency I just found out my Lexus fob hops on 312.00 and 314.0.

I was able to then do a RAW capture of the frequency on the AM650 setting.

I couldn't get the capture to replay though but I at least figured out how to find it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-19
Had they done that then everyone including backers would have theirs delivered later.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-19
Looking forward to it!

I would say don't take the risk. Besides why pay double+ for it when patience is a virtue. I love my flipper and waiting was a pain but I don't think spending that much extra on the hopes someone isn't scamming you is the best idea. Granted that's basically what Kickstarter could be... The flipper ppl should get caught up soon, save your money.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-18
Last time I used the forwarding I paid FEDEX economy 24 dollars for 5 deodorants old spice (yeah I know, I have a very specific taste for deodorants), so Im thinking it should be something around that, I can confirm once its shipped.

Well see!  I too purchased one from eBay as a confirmed order. I shouldve canceled it after I saw all the new stock show up. But they were out of stock before I realized, and luckily before I canceled my eBay order. The seller has kept me informed though. And they messaged me right away once flipper announced the most recent shipping plans. Sure it could still be a scam but doesnt eBay guarantee I get it or my money back?   If that does happen and eBay doesnt refund my money then Ill ask my bank to do a chargeback. I paid like $270 for mine. Hoping I dont get scammed- Ill be so mad at myself for not canceling the eBay and buying one from flipper. But I kept missing the restocks and felt this was my best chance instead of having to wait til almost next year.  The ones people have in had are asking way too much. Ive seen some people on FB groups selling them for closer to retail and had them in hand. Sadly I missed those as well. I will update my answer if/when I receive mine. If I dont have it or a tracking number by July 1st Ill be likely contacting eBay. Wish me luck!

Lol.... it's late but I wish Reddit would allow images to be inserted without links to images (mobile).....or I'd show you the CLI I got.

&gt;after seeing people terminal into their flipper off their phone.

YOU CAN DO THAT?  I've been out of the community for too long -_-

Anyways I'm glad you're still going to town with your Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-18
I'm being a lazy typer tonight and disgruntled after seeing people terminal into their flipper off their phone.

I finally got CLI and was excited.
Let me expound.
I have figured out the whole music thing.
It's RTTF tones and can be uploaded in txt or fmf.

What I meant was I finally got docker installed, finally downloaded the source code and realized = I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
I'm not a developer, just learning python now..... I think this is C, right?

I don't know crap about NFC or RFID, or modulation in general.

I bought this thing to be able to just enjoy it and wish I could contribute more to the overall project, all I did was contribute Tetris track which someone else actually improved.

I was hoping to be able to packet capture but this device isn't really built for that.....never will be.

I'm seeing packet capture connection with phone to Flipper and wifi board plugged in....there's hope there.

Sorry if that sounded confusing.... I've been plugging away at a few apps for the OSINT community and have just decided to "stay in my lane" as that us providing hard enough. 

Appreciate the time you took to explain.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-18
Didnt they just restock them like a few days ago?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Custom firmware for music is no longer required.  The music player (and many other apps) have internal file managers that can navigate different directories for you.

As for the infrared files, you can just copy them into their designated folder on your card.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-06-17
Music isn't a problem. 
I got the flipper firmware downloaded and just didn't know what to do with it.

I think I can just drop the whole IR db right I to the ir folder right?

I've given up on trying figural this out.
Couldn't get my wifi board to flash....  I stopped using VM for my labs because of USB connectivity.....ugh.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Ah, bummer. I just thought of that today but haven't looked into how they work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Not sure if you've succeeded on loading the music, but I've updated the song to Flipper's new music format.  All you need to do is drop the FMF file into the music folder on your Flipper SD card.

Is there too many zeros in that or a typo.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Not my rules. It sucks. But I think they are just covering their own ass. It's an open source device ironically. 

Stupid. In comparison really. Knives aren't illegal. But if you stabbed someone with it yes. It's the individuals fault not the community. If we say they could be used to kill or hurt a person. 

Same rules for when we used to have blank CDs. Nothing illegal about it unless you put copyrighted material on it which you did hot purchase or have the licence for.

There should be no harm to link 'informative material' ie. Links. It's up to the individual what is done with and the responsibility falls on them and not the subreddit, company or original poster. Just as long as a disclaimer is made prior to post.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Yeah if youre really concerned about helping people maybe price it for the cost of what you bought it for. Maybe people wont be as harsh as ebay is the right place if you want to sell for profit
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
My bad for asking the question - I assumed we'd all be able to independently dev this functionality with the official build, and while the repo was tied to a violation build, if they have packages everyone can take advantage of, possible for an exception from rule 1 based on context?

Only one way to find out.  Buy it. The pre order code only cost me $10. You could ask to see the email with half of the code censored. Or get the seller to get a response from company to prove it is still currently not used.

Flashing through qFlipper backs up the internal flash before flashing. Flashing via ST-Link/WiFi-devboard/DFU does not, though.

Weirdly though - my shop app says it's shipped.

1 : 2022-06-17
Hi! Thank you for the great flipper resources! I am trying to give my flipper its level that it lost during a firmware flash. I can't seem to make your code work.   
  
Could you please kindly provide a bit more details? I am largely an idiot in programming.   
  
Here's what I did. I downloaded python, downloaded your .py file, downloaded the dolphin state file from flipper via qflipper, replaced the input and output directory with the location of the flipper state file on my pc, and ran the code. It keeps returning unicode errors.   
  
I also can't directly run the thing from desktop or terminal, it would just flash and quit. Can only run that on the IDLE editor. Am I doing something wrong here? Am I supposed to execute other codes than the py1 file?   
  
Sorry for violating any rules or such. Literally my first very post on reddit.
-------------------------------

Not true. First uk/eu batch does indeed include EU countries. What is a shame is that, based on responses on twitter, there are at least 3 backers in Germany that were postponed to a later delivery and one pre-order that is included in the first batch (still to Germany). Nonsense. Thats the same that happened to a bunch of US backers
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Prioritization doesnt mean splitting the delivery batches, but instead rearranging the batches to ensure backers get theirs first.

No one has skipped any lines. They had a few thousand US-region devices left over from a prior run and they sold them. Currently the next wave of devices is being packed for shipping with UK packing/shipping first, EU packing/shipping second, and US packing/shipping last. Is it possible that political and shipping realities will put devices in US hands first? Maybe. But your entire premise on prioritization is incorrect.
-------------------------------

Like the other post said, talking about "how could I theoretically use this tool to steal a Tesla" is not a great for the community in general. Its kinda like asking "hypothetically, how many rounds of ammo should I have to rob a bank" in a gun subreddit. Not a great look
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
Breaking orders apart and prioritizing backers are two different things. Seems that preorders on Germany are being delivered in the first European wave and backers on Germany are being left for the second. Thats lack or prioritization, prioritizing backers on the first wouldnt change the cost as long as priority would go by: cost at first, backers at second
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
My firmware is super custom (pulled straight off github and used without regard for consequence) and my flipper level seems to persist.

I will say though, after about the same amount of time as OP, mine isn't quite halfway to lvl 2. I've travelled abroad and 'hacked' at least two things in each of the hardware categories available.

Honestly, not too worried about the level, but I was curious to find out if it does anything for anyone else. I've seen you can adjust it manually by editing the file, I just haven't bothered yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-17
It changes the appearance of your dolphin. Each increase in level increases the amount of cyborg stuff that appears.

Yeah, just saw that. Apparently they will be splitting the EU shipment in 2.

Lucky you! I didn't receive anything yet

I realized this real quick. As stated, this is a sub full of tomagotchi enthusiasts.... Hilarious 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Lmao look at this dude...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Saying flipper users are pen testers is a hard overstatement.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Most of the mods don't look to have lights or screens why would they need batteries ? Odd
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
The magnetic connectors have wires so all data would go through those probably?

There is no prioritization, but shipping rewards and preorders together doesn't slowdown entire deliverly. I don't think that there are enough preorders for subwave: there would be subwaves and without preorders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
ya'll know that tesla owners can just code out and/or remove it from their charging stations, right?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Well let's say it was theoretically possible? It's irrelevant. 

A fork can be used to brutally murder someone. A 3D printer can print a gun. This isn't the first security research tool and it won't be the last. 

I think it's great to show capabilities and examples of those capabilities because it highlights issues and helps push for improvements. A click bait title is irrelevant.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
It's about cost management. If they tried to break it up so that it was in order, their shipping costs would go through the roof. They need to ship as many as they can at one time to each region then have it unpacked and individually sent. Trying to keep order in that chaos is near impossible but every second of waiting is worth it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Are you flashing it with "custom" firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
TLDR: It's faster for everyone that way

1 : 2022-06-16
Flipper status is stored in `/int/dolphin.state` on the internal flash.

I've done several updates via both qflipper and SD card update, and even with alternate firmware this file has been preserved.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16

Honestly, just keep using it everyday. I mess with the Tesla Battery port my rfid and garage gate
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I'm interested in the vulnerability and would like to know if my tool can replicate the same attack. I'm not looking to steal a tesla. I have one and I want to do more research about how it can be attacked.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I live in the UK and yesterday I got an email stating that the carrier is waiting to receive my parcel
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I haven't done it myself, but I think there is a single file on the Flipper that stores this information, so you might be able to backup that file and restore it after flashing (maybe this should be an option in the software!)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Mine doesn't level up at all, it seems to reset every time you re-flash/update it and I'm constantly re-flashing it when I'm trying to program it, so mines still at level 1 lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Yeah this sub is rough. The tesla capture is very easy with flipper, the bruteforce needs to be done in like aws or a laptop. To be honest a shocking number of vehicles can be broken into just by capturing waves with a flipper and some server time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I've waited this long, I'm happy to wait a little longer knowing I got it at such a good price, plus there will already be an established community of flippers to learn from
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Do the levels actually do anything? I can't get mine to stay happy, if I don't use it  for a few days it gets upset, so I just gave up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Doesnt seem to be the case, as the first wave at the us and now Eu includes preorder flippers and backers from the same exact country didnt receive a tracking number, which indicates lack of prioritization on backers, once again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Is there anyway to put the flipper in a blank nfc key mode to be acceptable by NFC readers?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
There was the answer on Discord, that preorders doesn't affect on other waves, because there are three SKU for different regions. This SKUs are produced sequentially.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I meant the prioritization on the waves, in between backers and preorders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Inital shipping order was described here: https://blog.flipperzero.one/shipping-started/
It was slightly changed, all changes and reasons are on ship.flipp.dev
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
They dropped an update today at https://ship.flipp.dev/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Maybe on the FlipperOne when it comes out, or if a suitable antenna can be added to the IO
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
The YouTube video is not directed specifically towards the Flipper Zero community. The video was posted for an audience of people in the security industry to be made aware of a vulnerability.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Not a general audience.

The audience of a PEN TESTING TOOL.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Yes, that's the title of the video directed towards a general audience. When posted on this subreddit, a subreddit for an kickstarter fundraised product that already had dubious perceptions to the public, it seems as though you are stating that this product can be used to steal Teslas.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
That's the title of the video you half wit...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
You got shit on for saying "Stealing a tesla". That's like me showing a vulnerability in banking software by saying "Stealing money from bank accounts". It's not what you showed, it's the light you showed it in
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
This definitely has potential for sure!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I posted this a couple days ago and just got shit on by all the tomogotchi kids.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I know i wish we can clone a fastrak here in Cali
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
Nope. Same with Transcore transponders like the ones they use down in Florida.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
This tag uses UHF RFID technology, Flipper doesn't support it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
That's actually helpful.
I tried to flash the firmware on my wifi board and never got it to recognize the board with minicom.
Going to try putty on Linux this weekend.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-16
I've had an update fail. Recovery was easy and flawless. I've tried a few different ones and bouncing between them is painless.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Yeah, but I am lazy. I know and appreciate that suggestion. I tend to break things easily. Want to have one for testing and one that is stable.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
You can always get into dfu mode and reflash the ofw in case something goes wrong
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Oh it has that? oh boy idk what I'm doing I guess.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Can't help you with that in this sub. The mods frown upon firmware that alllws "illegal" features
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
so it took me to a readme which took me to a site off one of the things which i guess is getting flipper unleashed.... but i put all the files in then the subremoteremix says config is incorrect? any idea?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Any updates here? Someone did skylanders with them?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
You can manually edit the file on your computer and change the frequency there
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Is Flipper able to re-magnetize prox cards?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
where did you get the accessories for it? looks nice!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
At this point, Flipper Zero has never been put up for normal sale. Many people backed the Kickstarter and most have received their devices (some haven't), others pre-ordered during a past pre-ordering period and many of them have also received devices (some haven't). In the last few weeks they sold through a spare batch of US-region devices which are just now shipping.

From what I understand reading the Discord, they intent to open up normal sales at some point in Q3. The eventual hope is that you could easily go to Amazon, buy one, and have it within a couple days. For now they're directly shipping from the factories and it takes awhile (especially when customs are involved).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Im there, just too lazy to read it lol lots of messages
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
GREAT JOB!!!!

* Updated perfectly. In fact, I have never had a single firmware issue, ever. Last two updates via BT through OTA mobile app (Android)
* **Would like to suggest a feature I think would be easily implemented, maybe?**
* A change log feature in the android/iOS to see the new changelog. Unless I am missing something and not seeing it?
* Honestly, I wish I could buy another one to test unapproved firmware on. I am not adventurous enough to deal with flashing ext firmware at this point, regardless of what it can do.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
I purchased mine on May 27. Just realized that I never got an email order confirmation, but I did save the order confirmation page.

There's no link on the site to enter an order # to confirm anything, so I guess I continue to wait.

They charged my credit card, so at least I know the order went through. That, and I have an order # from the order confirmation page.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
I hate to say it but eBay is your best bet. Technically the last restock want supposed to happen, they just had extra that where on the way to USA Backers and sold the extras to the public. There still trying to fill orders to Europe based backers.
Personally I dont think there will be more to sell till the fourth quarter at least.

Sorry, I had mentioned it on a Reddit post after I didnt hear back from the initial ticket, got confused. While I appreciate the volume you are getting, I guess I am just frustrated by the time gaps on communication. Ticket opened 5/23, first response 5/30 asking for serial, 6/2 asking for firmware flash, 6/6 asking to reseat cable, and nothing since. I am happy to hear that it is on its way and am excited to start experimenting with jt.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
im guessing the title should be **Release 0.60.2**
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
Thanks, looking into your ticket I see things were not exactly like you mentioned in your comment (i.e. I asked you to recover your device through DFU because you only mentioned having updated your firmware) and 4 days after this our engineers asked you to attempt a fix that has worked for others so you don't have to wait for your replacement to arrive.  


Either way, your replacement has already been approved and is currently awaiting shipment.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
721-966919. Ticket originally opened on 5/23. Last update was on the 8th where it was being send back to engineering for the second time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-15
What is your ticket number? I'm not sure if I was the one to deal with your ticket (likely not at first at least) but I'd like to look into this just in case.

As for response time, please understand that we have been *incredibly* swamped lately, and I'm dealing with 200+ tickets a day, which is why it can take a while to get a response.

1 : 2022-06-15
Honestly man I would recommend getting on the Discord channel for it and just kind of reading through that daily.

Almost all of the US backers have already gotten their order. Shop orders are leftovers of the US model which are ready to ship compared to those that have not been shipped to other countries yet.

Oh snaps. That was the time I ordered mine. I checked just now and it shows tracking number. LFG!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I was the 28th.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I ordered within the first couple hours that the limited stock was put up for sale and I now have a tracking number. It's still being "prepared" so it doesn't seem to be in the mail system yet. I signed up for email and test alerts but never got one. On my order page now, however, I can see the added tracking.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Same here as well.
Preparing for shitment. 
I ordered on the 2nd

I don't remember uttering any of the names of the Gawd.

This is what we call a debruijin script and is available on github. For use in ethical hacking home experiments only.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Ordered May 26, no email, but when I checked my order about an hour ago there was a tracking number.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
There are still kickstarter backers who haven't gotten them yet, once all of those are out they will start pumping out the pre orders, then they will do the shop orders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Same for me. If I click the tracking number it says my order is being prepared for ship.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I didn't get a shipping email. My Shopify app told me it shipped
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I ordered the 7th, I havent received the email yet but I refreshed the view order page and there now a tracking number
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I ordered May 27, still hasn't shipped either.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
When did you order it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Completely dulled, like if Excalibur had the edge of a butter knife. But there is the awesome flipper firmware that unlocks its full potential, its just very illegal to use in public.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Ordered mine May 31, no sign of a shipping email
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Same! Ordered at the same timeframe as OP
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
My flipper just shipped!!!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I get the feeling that the flipper software had to be pretty tame to manufacture and ship to prevent any potential issues shipping them around the world. 

If it was packed with tools that fully utilized the hardware, it wouldve been a very powerful ready to use device in the hands of a lot of people that dont know what theyre doing (myself included lol). With the media how it is, I could easily see Russian hackers deploy thousands of devices that can steal your house keys and your Tesla from a block away as news blast 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Id almost be more interested in knowing where they where shipping from. Cuz I guess there 1000 were previously stuck Im customs on the way to us backers, so maybe shipping wont be as long as the site previously indicated if there already in the us or at least part way through customs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
I emailed them about a week later and they said it was looking to be mid June.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Its a permitted frequency in Australia.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
The batch is for EU+UK. Non-EU countries (excepto for the UK) are Rest of the World
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Even He has no himdamn clue
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Is this batch for EU or Europe? Not all countries in Europe is in the EU.

I live in a European country, and my shipping address is not locked yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
according to https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/frequencies 433MHz is allowed in Australia
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Custom firmware is what youre looking for. Start there. 

The flipper discord would be a good resource.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Yes, but saying how will get this post removed, as it's probably illegal in your country.

That said... you should take a close look at the forks in flipperzero's github.

The Flipper can do a lot of things and I'd recommend checking this out [Awesome Flipper Zero](https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero)

I've used mine to clone my RFID badges to my T5577 ring and it makes it really convenient to swap between them. I also use it for various remotes, both IR and Sub-Ghz. It's an amazing tool.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Awesome Flipper on GitHub is a good starting place.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Ive noticed a surprising lack of content regarding real world applications for the Flipper. I suspect that there will be a lot more soon, since you can buy them far easier now in the United States
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Me I'd be interested if there were some kind of "Getting started" with examples of stuff you could mess around with once you get started. I know a lot about software security but I'm a noob when it comes to hardware, so even though I received it idk what to do with it except turn on my TV with it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
There's "A collection of awesome resources for the Flipper Zero device." On GitHub that you might find interesting. Google around a bit and you'll find it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Not officially. You can't talk about links to non-official firmware here. They have to comply with regulatory standards for each country. Like fight club, we don't talk about Flipperclub.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Well, that's a loaded question...

Have you downloaded all the ir's? You have to have the .ir's in question downloaded somewhere. ONce there, you use a file management software to drag and drop to qflipper folders.

By dev branch they mean experimental versions of the firmware that haven't been fully tested.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
i have a soundbar and tv remote that i'm trying to read. I can see the led flash when i press buttons but the flipper can't read them
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
What remote are you trying to read?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
It doesnt seem to work that way. I got a DOA unit, emailed support on 5/23, saying what I did for troubleshooting, including reinstalling firmware. A week later they responded asking for my device info, which I responded to In an hour. 4 days after that they asked me to try reinstalling firmware, which I repeated even though I said I did it in my original email, and responded that day. A week after that they responded, had me disassemble the device and check a cable that wasnt the problem. That was a week ago and I havent heard back since. Every support back and forth seems to take a week. It is greatly disappointing for a DOA unit.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Sorry for the super late response. u/OmahGawd115 beat me to it! I backed it on Kickstarter.

My Flipper will read one of my hospital work badges but not the other (my main badge is some kind of an HID iClass MIFARE, and it won't pick up with the RFID scanner or HID analyzer).  I'm really hopeful that it'll get added soon (or eventually, anyways)!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Can you advise on a HID iClass tag?

Europe?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Wtf, I got that before they announced the stock was done and ready to start shipping. It was locked at processing in Hong Kong for 2 months.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Nope. Not even on backerkit
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
You should have a tracking number from flipper in your assigned email, check there and see what it says.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Does it say processing in Hong Kong?

I'm nowhere near ready for dev stuff. One of these days.....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Oh wow, that's an incredible use-case! My only recommendation is that you stay on the Release branch and carry your badges with you as a backup, as the dev branch (and sometimes even releases) can accidentally break emulation sometimes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Im glad people are making their life easier with it. I pledged to the kickstarter so i can open garage doors and get into my house with it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
What an amazing way to use Flipper! That's really heartwarming to know that it can save you time which is so important in this case. Thank you for your job
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
That's cool, how do you pair it as a new garage door remote?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
How tho
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
You definitely get it. We either gotta rifle through the collection of guest badges in the rig hoping the right one didn't get lost or wait forever with a patient for security to give us access. This streamlines it immensely. And it's given me a great reason to finally learn some friggin coding in my downtime. I can't wait to use this guy to his full potential. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
Supporting 32 hospitals in the US I had a huge collection of badges. So glad you got this little guy. So much easier.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-14
But of course. Also, no one knows what the fuck this is. Our IT guy came in while I was sitting at the table playing with it and never even gave it a second look. Tbh I was a little disappointed. I was trying to stunt a bit.

I'd it possible yours was made before mass production. I remember reading they had to change displays. Maybe a fault in old displays?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
GIT clone the Flipper irdb and drop like 2gb of IR on your FZ.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I really want to try a flipper some day. The tama mode seems fun and also all the other fun stuff too. Your collection overall is really nice!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Im not sure I didnt make it I bought it like this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
What color did you get?

How did you get the black one?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
The Flipper is designed to be always on, so there's no need to turn it off except than to save battery power.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Probably not, all the defective flippers go to our hardware devs do diagnose why and how it happened and what we can do to mitigate it in the future, and some of the diagnostic operations are destructive and/or time-consuming, so it's both faster and more reliable to just send a brand new device from our current stock.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Ill put it on my GitHub and link it when I get off my shift. Check back tomorrow.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Apparently not, considering what happened lol. I never turn mine off though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Interesting I leave mine on 24/7 and nothing is wrong with it. Should I turn it off at night?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
The name is a friendly serial number. Assuming you get the same one back, or replace the screen yourself, that should stay the same.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Disagree.  Its Teslas problem.  I know you dont want people to get the wrong idea about Flipper, but the public hates Tesla, not Flipper.  It wont be a problem.  
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Right? I just let him sleep, he looks so sad when you go to the turn off device menu
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Mine is named Ostravu. I wish I could keep him. I've grown rather attached to Ozzy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Thank you so much! I'll be sure to reach out as soon as I can!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I'll keep that in mind if I ever encounter this issue myself. I love how quick the team reacts to these issues in the public sphere. Best wishes! I'm loving my device, Tesp00s, btw. Any idea what the name means?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
This looks like factory defect. The display might have looked OK before this happened, but it most probably was going to do it anyways at some point, so leaving it on wouldn't make any difference. Please message our support team at support@flipperdevices.com, we'll try to get you a new one as soon as possible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Wait people turn theirs off?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Bruh...
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-06-13
Damn, I'm sorry. Try looking at the site manual for any other reset type tricks that may help. And I hear the company is quick to help.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Unfortunately, it's still there... looks like I'll try to get in touch with the company. Thank you for the advice, though!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I truly hope it helps, friend!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Not a silly question at all! I'm still learning how to use it, and I didn't even think to do that! I'm gonna go try it right quick
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I hate asking what seems like a silly question,  but did you try holding back button and left arrow to reset it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
If you have that it would be appreciated
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Ordered mine a few weeks ago. Sooooo excited and cant wait to receive it. Getting antsy over here.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I'm not disagreeing with you at all, I just think it's important to realize the battery will likely outlast the useful lifetime of the product without any special treatment. Even if it doesn't, small Li-Ion packs are usually under $10. So you have to consider the effort vs payoff. Different people may draw different conclusions as to whether the payoff is worth it.

Everything you said is 100% correct though, I'm not disagreeing with you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
According to studies on lithium batteries you can double the life (cycle count) by keeping them in the range I mentioned.
https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
&gt;If you want to make the battery last longer I'd say charge to 80% Max and discharge no lower than 20%.

And even this, while true, is almost certainly more caution than you should ever need to take. Lithium Ion batteries will give you many years of service without any special care. Even if you're still using the Flipper Zero ten years from now when the battery life has maybe dipped to 80% of its starting life, it will likely be very easy and cheap to swap in a new one. I say just use and enjoy the device rather than inconveniencing yourself for years just to squeeze out a little more life. The Flipper Five would probably be out before you'd even be thinking about replacing the battery.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
You can even do this with your phone! Damn awesome!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I don't have mine yet but I think it's simply a matter of getting the .ir from your repository of choice into the right place in the Flipper file system
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Everything with a lithium battery should have its own BMS, we don't have to worry about overcharging devices ever.  The flipper will stop taking power when it is full.  If you want to make the battery last longer I'd say charge to 80% Max and discharge no lower than 20%.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Damn that charger must be pretty *angry*

[Insert forced laugh]
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
Have you installed the qFlipper app on your desktop machine? You can mount the Flipper using it, and drag files into the appropriate directories.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-13
I use my MacBook Air and Anger 60w fast charger. Maybe not the best as it won't stop the charge after it's full but it works.

This is a pen testing tool....

The past few days has shown me that the flipper zero sub is nothing more than a glorified tomagachi sub.
-------------------------------

This is not something we should be publicly advertising. And not something anyone in the community should participate in. We should be letting Tesla know though so they can work up a better solution.

Problem with this is that Flipper can't do this. Flipper needs to have the key against the device to clone it, this being said you would first have to clone it via Tesla app then use Flipper to clone it. 

However, I think that the rolling code issue will still effect Tesla keys, if this is true (not sure, due to it being NFC and not a regular fob) it could desync it and you'll have to start over again. 

I am definitely going to try this tho, buddy owns a Tesla at work and I love messing with him and his car. Great share!

I'm not sure if you can call what  a guy who's waited 2+(or so) for an open source tricorder that's been a wet dream of so many since its conception years ago "putting down". That alludes to there being a worth, or weight put against the subject..
No sir, I do believe this is "carping", ie the present participle of "carp".

Right, aren't you guys (mostly) from Russia? The only reason I mentioned (typed) in the first place is I come from a country that literally fights to celebrate (BBQ, get drunk and fight some more) other nation's conflicts (May 5th), let alone the weird shit that happens when we're actively engaged in a land war on one of our borders (every Billy and most Todds would enthusiastically be involved). The fact that you've been to task as well as you have is commendable. Lesser folks would've taken the money and ran at far less.

AM/FM: try both or look up your device in a database like fccid.io to see if there is documentation about the signal type (there isnt always).

Bandwidth (the number): the lower bandwidth numbers capture a more precise signal in a narrower range of frequencies according to the [Flipper docs](https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/modulation).

For example, my car remote is specced for 314.25 MHz while the Flippers closest default frequency is 315.00 MHz. AM650 might be better when listening on 315.00 MHz to pick up the neighboring 314.25 MHz. But I configured the Flipper to listen on 314.25 MHz exactly, so I use AM270.

Funny story about mine, my friend heard about me having a flipper and wanted to do it on his tesla. For some reason when I was trying to do it on his, I didn't realize I was actually opening someone else's because he had a dual motor(apparently flipper can't open tesla dual motors) and the other was a regular model y. It didn't take me until I heard an outburst coming from the owner to realize what I was doing.

It got worse when a well known hobo in our community started spilling things into his mind like "it's the aliens man" and "the government is watching you".

Long shot. Maybe whoever packed them in Australia. If was thorough recorded the uid to match with customer. Just a long shot here. 

Could be tracked if it was ever plugged into a computer by flipper devices inc. just a long shot as I said. But is possible if was recorded to track it if used on PC.

You misunderstood.

It's next to impossible to offend me. Especially some random person on the internet that claimed to be a security professional who gave the opinion that you did. This is a subreddit for a pen testing tool. It's kind of stupid for you to stick around (and comment) on videos  about vulnerabilities that are directly related to such said pen testing tool in the manner that you did.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-11
It was never my intention to offend you, so I'm sorry if you took my comment personally. I was posted a personal opinion on the state of the subreddit, spurred on by posts like these.

I'll try to steer clear of you on the discord channel so we can minimize interaction between us in the future.

You have made it blatantly clear that you are absolutely not in the security field by your replies to a video showing nothing more than a new vulnerability with a major car manufacturer. You sound like one of those liberal snowflakes that are offended by everything...

If you don't like videos that show new vulnerabilities, shut off the computer and walk away. I mean, do you comment about every single thing that you don't like on the internet...?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-11
Right?! Being in a security field makes me want to fight off 'ignorant' posts like this. I just wanted to have fun with a cute device, with a great community. Now every other post is a replay attack on tesla charge ports.

I scored one off eBay, with silicone case and developer board. After tax, 329.00. There are a few cool sellers out there that MIGHT actually hook you up. Just message them first. if they know you are serious about it for development, I think you can offer someone 300 and get lucky.

I generally go by the tried and true process of elimination. 

If you know your device and signal you may be able to look it up and figure it out but otherwise I just cycle through until I find what works.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-11
Wow, I got the same color and silicone case too. I guess the case doesnt protect a lot. Yikes, just means one thing. Be more carefully and keep away from kids, even though your the big kid. Youre still responsible for how you physically handle things on a day to day basis. So, for future or present flipper owners. It may look like a cellphone or digital toy but still treat it like its a very expensive watch or etc you dont want damaged. Again, your a grown ass adult. You should know better most items are from China so shit is gonna break due to influx. Just sorry this happened to you.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-11
You do not have no recourse. You need to lodge a complaint with the ACCC, The [postal industry ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/How-we-can-help/postal-industry-ombudsman) or office of fair trading in your state. Also lodge a police report of it being stolen. It is technically stolen at this point. Contact Sendle and inform them you have taken this action (you can try calling them first and telling them you will be going to take this action, sometimes that works also)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
Mine showed up this way and I filed an insurance claim through customer support. I guess depends on how long ago you received it. As a result, I have one to sell for parts but it's screen is cracked also :/

1 : 2022-06-10
There are various types of Roku remotes and they are all RF, some in the 2.4 GHz range, some in the 5 GHz range - nothing that indicate they conform to any standard but their own.  


Higher end models at one point had an IR receiver as well to allow you to implement them into more complex home theater setups.  Although I'm not sure that is still true now that they implemented controls via phone app.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
To me after I "Unleased" my Flipper I had to ask the same question. I started to have to look at the world differently, I started to pretend I was playing Watch Dogs IRl. 

From there you find what grabs you, at first it was car fob cloning, next it was wanting to read my dogs tracker, and now I am exploring using the GPIO. 

To be blunt this shits a rabbit hole and once you find something you want to hack, then the fun begins. Until you figure out what you want it for, then it's really nothing but a cool remote.

Car cloning: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/u922ur/car\_key\_cloning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/u922ur/car_key_cloning/)

The cad model for the tpu case is okayish and i think thicker-&gt; more lip to protect screen if youre worried. There are also models for cases available that cover the whole unit (still controllable by the phone app though)

Some support bluetoot (le?) And some only support ir. You can usually tell, by looking under the battery lid to see if there is a pair button. If there is no pair button, then it is ir only. If there is, there might be a chance that it is rf only (I believe).

Waste of a good Flipper, honestly... Use a 4$ Seeedunio Xiao and Mouse.h library. It takes like 4 lines of code (6 if you want to go absolutely crazy and light the LED!).

Bad analogy, being an idiot gets you a kid, being clumsy breaks yours stuff, the case isn't going to stop you being clumsy, and it's not going to stop you breaking stuff.

I have a buddy who never used screen protectors or cases on his phone. I do, and asked him why he didn't protect his fancy new phone. His answer was an analogy about having sex with a condom vs without a condom, I don't remember exactly, but essentially he uses the pull out method.

Check out [this link](https://github.com/wetox-team/flipperzero-goodies/blob/master/scripts/fff/json_to_nfc.py); you can use it to convert NFC files you create to something that the Flipper Zero can read.

I'm hoping since the screen doesn't require any silicone that they might have extras of those. But also, in the discord i got some good suggestions on how to get it by remaking it with CNC if i can find someone who could machine that for me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
If you are going to break stuff you will. Putting a case on it doesn't stop it. I never put a case on anything, but I also don't drop things or bang things into other things. I'm sure all the people I've seen with phone cases have smashed screens, so...
-------------------------------

But it's got the lip.....

Damn, you did that in the silicone case? I'm petrified now, I don't even have that little orange fucker.

1 : 2022-06-10
It is in the literal sense innocent, you are causing no damage, you aren't exposing any weak spots, you aren't keeping anything you don't own, etc. It's a better prank than taking someone's tire air caps as it's less destructive.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
People cant even buy these and youre expecting replacement parts? 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
It can be very surprising and even worrisome to some people, you might feel that it's effectively innocent, which it might be, but knowing someone fucked with your car isn't a very nice thing.

awesome! was considering buying a remote to do this. thanks for contributing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
I know this isn't what you asked for, but while I wait for my silicon cover to arrive, I picked up this little earbuds hardcase for tossing the flipper into my backpack on trips/outings:

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N0NX6PK?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N0NX6PK?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

&amp;#x200B;

It's a perfect fit tbh, and the little elastic mesh pocket is perfect for the usb cable. I will say though, don't use the little loop on it to attach a carabiner and hang it off your waist. I almost lost mine doing that because the little loop started falling apart. I got home and realized it was on a thread. \*phew\*

It's not that big of a deal man. You'll get your items. This is what instant gratification does to people 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-10
As of right now Ive done the following with my Flipper:

-	Pair as new Garage door remote
-	Copy building ID Badge
-	Use the Amiibo feature, mostly ACNH
-	Copy some IR remotes
-	Test some BadUSB scripts
-	Open Tesla charge ports
-	TouchTunes remote (havent tested yet)
-	Played with different firmware

Doesnt seem like too much, but software is still really early and new features/protocols are constantly being added.  Its definitely got a good community and I hope to be able to contribute once I learn some knowledge to share lol

Its a really fun project!

They told me my dev board and rubber case would be shipped in July and I ordered a month and a half ago. Not disappointed when I emailed them asking for an ETA they got right back to me. I understand they are busy and Im not impatient so I can wait
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
The device is incredibly capable, however what the stock software currently offers is limited. Good news is the software is rapidly getting better with new protocols and features every week. So even if you get it right now when not a lot is supported, in near future the device will be able to do so much more
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
Case is great quality, buy one if possible.

The silicon case is well worth the few extra dollars. It gives the device a more playful (durable) vibe while adding virtually no bulk. It's easy to take on and off, and I don't see any reason why not to get it.

Other people have made their own 3D-printed cases, which I've [linked in my Awesome repo.](https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero#modules--cases)

As for an orange wrist strap, check out [this cheap one on Amazon.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BYXRCND) It's not necessary either, and some might prefer to use their Flipper without one (since attaching it can be a PITA) but to each their own.

As for a screen protector, I doubt any exist for the size, but the screen is already made of semi-durable plastic and I'm not worried about mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09

While loosely related to pentesting, I've been reading ["Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17891457-unmasking-the-social-engineer) by Christopher Hadnagy. If physical pentesting is your thing, then there's no doubt social engineering is a necessity.

Thanks! I've been ghosting around the official *(and other)* Discord's for more stuff to put in but it's a lot to keep up with all the time. Still can't believe its [reached over 1k stars](https://dj.je/fz) (kind of scary getting an email from GitHub about designating an account successor out of the blue...)

I barely knew anything about C before finding the device, but today I just submitted [my first PR](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/1307) to the official firmware! Can't wait to see how this community grows.

I ordered a super zero a long time ago pre-release. I was one of the first to get one in the US and that's when I realized I wanted that silicone case, and the Wi-Fi Dev board. So I have to online ordered it and yeah it takes a little bit for these things to get delivered, but so long as you paid, for it know it will come.

You can do the same on the app! Or at least should be able to.  

Open the app, ofc. 

Go to options probably in the bottom right. 

File manager next. Mine is under "experimental."

Browse to the ext storage and then onto the file you want. I just tap the file and it downloads a local copy to my phone.

Carefully stick it in brown paper bag with just the right cutout in the side and control it over Bluetooth. You can get very creative. 

I've got plans to sniff an access badge in a similarly sneaky way.

Agreed, the case is great. Orange case on my black flipper is legit. I noticed small scratches on my screen and didn't want it to get worse so I used scotch tape and an exacto knife to clean it up. Turned out great.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
Love my silicone cases, they're up on par quality with any others I've ever used. 

Don't know about a pre-made orange wrist strap, but orange paracord is pretty easy to scare up on Amazon. I bought a variety-color pack of decent quality generic straps from Amazon and used the Grey and Black ones for my flippers. 

Screen savers can be pretty easily made, just get discontinued model (cheap) any non-glass protector, an x-acto knife and a ruler...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
how is the quality of the silicone case before and after the dyeing, i was considering getting one with the order of my unit but i was concerned about the quality. i can always order one later but id like to hear from others opinions, and also where i can order an orange wrist strap and possibly a screen protector for the unit. thanks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
I've DEFINITELY thought about getting a Digimon lately.  I also haven't looked much into the "Tamagachi" part of Flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
I did find a Tesla owner manual that mentioned the flap would only open when the car was unlocked or within range of an authorised phone.
I suspect thats why I havent had any luck yet, but I also havent had an opportunity to test on more than a handful of Teslas
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-09
Thanks alot!!! Really appreciate it

I actually just bought my very first tamagotchi last week at 22 years old. I litterally could not wait to get my Flipper zero so i thought i would get a Tamagotchi Pix to keep me entertained while I wait for my Flipper. So far, im enjoying it and really loving the fact that it has a colored screen!

Totally they will I just wish I didnt get it yet lol I keep it in my pocket all day and longingly look at the little dolphin wondering what it could be. And I use it 3 times a day for my aircons and tv haha 

Great device just wanted a reason to have a tamagotchi again

It's hard to say I am not disappointed by the flipper not having the dumb mode. I was actually most excited for it. Sure I can go buy a tamagotchi but it is not the same. I want it to control my aircons, my tvs and lights and also be a tamagotchi....

Oh yeah, I love little devices like this! I had the original Tamagotchi and Digimon. And then there was the one you could use to scan barcodes, Skannerz? I'd love to see more modern virtual pets with cool features like that. 

I have a pwnagotchi, which is really cool but is a real pain to get working right. I've learned a lot by playing with it though, which is kind of the point I guess. Super excited for the Flipper!

What is the tamagotchi feature? I must have missed that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-08
How are the digimons? I bought 2 of the recent tamagotchi for myself and wife, but we got bored of them quick...I guess it wasn't as fun as we remember. Maybe cuz we have a cat and dog so taking care of the virtual one isn't really hooking us in.

Have you seen all these stuffs people post on github? We'll get a full fledged tamagotchi eventually.

You guys are misreading the tamagotchi side of the flipper. You don't feed him or play with it, it just levels up with use.

1 : 2022-06-08
I am legitimately shocked because the flipper was not cheap. I could understand a bunch of dolts getting one of it was $25 bucks but I have no idea how a bunch of non-techy people paid over $200 for something they have no idea about....

1 : 2022-06-08
Let's face facts here, if you look through the subreddit most people don't have a fucking clue on Flipper's capabilities, most people use it as a glorified remote oh and one guy used it to replace a simple push button by triggering a relay with it.

So, I'm definitely interested in the output at the back (when I finally get mine). The first step is to learn Arduino, correct?

Adding onto this comment for the OP - definitely start with a separate arduino doing this if you have basic/no electronics knowledge.

You can get arduino-compatibles for very cheap - you absolutely do not want to break your expensive, short-supply and high-demand hacking multitool thing.

There isn't much implementation or documentation for the GPIO yet. This is simply just setting an output to low or high. Which I learned from tinkering with raspberry Pis. 

There is tons of resources dedicated to GPIO use, from YouTube to raspberrypi's website, Arduino sources, etc.

Firstly look into basic electronics, letter on, if you intend to do the things with flipper's gpio look into embedded projects, such as Arduino ones, or projectes that use esp 8266 or 32.


There's loads of these on YouTube.

Bit by bit you should learn how to connect modules together, how to power them, when to use relay, when to use BJT when FET and when to use a transformer...

It's a deep rabbit hole but a beautiful one!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-08
I am completely braindead when it comes to the hardware side of Flipper. Do you have any recommendation on the best place to learn about how to use GPIO? 

I watched Youtube stuff but it's only based on the topic of that one subject, I'm looking to start from the beginning. Any advice would be helpful!
-------------------------------

The next batch will consist of all backers and all pre-orders. Sometime after that, the EU shop will open for everyone else.

Not sure what you mean.  I placed an order last week even though the store said out of stock, so I have an active order but with no status or estimate as to when it will ship.  This batch says itll ship in June, so Im hoping my order will be shipped at least at the same time, if not earlier.
-------------------------------

It's important to have a screwdriver that fits properly since they are said to be soft screws and you don't want to strip them out. That said, it's just a precision Philips driver. If you don't already have one, I'd recommend taking this opportunity to get a full set of electronics repair drivers from Amazon rather than just buying the one you need. A set with 200+ drivers with spudgers, tweezers, and other tools, costs around $20. You'll never be without the wrong driver again.

Yeah, my main use case is it's a backup remote for all the things! Trouble is I'm having trouble finding the remote for one of my fans, but all the others that I've copied I now have the signals backed up!

That's handy in my book. I can't do much about the hardware, but I have some ideas about how to make the software less cumbersome. Haven't taken the time yet, but appreciate the open-source firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-07
I mean realistically you can get into those with the secret menus anyway. They may have updated it so that can be turned off and only the manager card can access but 9/10 times itll still be on. Something something dot the I on the sprite lol.

To my understanding its not a car to car kind of situation that may differ but more a supercharger to supercharger issue.   Maybe.

It seems to me like its either a fixed code which goes back to a database and says this user is valid for 24hours or it adds something to the cup code when you pay for your refill.
I go to a cashier pay for the refill - they scan my cup then my cup is able to refill at any of the machines.
 I went in in the morning today and yesterdays had expired so I topped it up and then was able to refill- so its either a database or a change is made to the UHF tag. 
Would love to find out.

[This](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/rfid/rfid-handhelds/mc9090-z.html) is what I have. Portable, yes, but big and clunky. Not something you could just walk around with unnoticed! I bought one used for $99 on ebay, and took a gamble on it, not knowing if it had the software I'd need or not (it did). I'd not recommend one if you aren't familiar with these style devices.  

There are USB ones similar in size to the PM3, but I believe their read range is much less. I have no experience with them. This style is going to be the smallest out there though, as most of the serious ones are the size of a cable TV box, with antennas just as big!

If you do decide to get into UHF tags, you will want a reader that supports "EPC class 1 gen 2 tags, or C1G2" That's a mouthful!

Wonder how strict they are with the cups? Surely they're not activated at the PoS and just come enabled as a batch. 

Swipe a batch and scan em all in the shitter. Then can em and just swap between codes every refill. Not sure how often I'd be using more than 1/hr anyway though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
Even has recorded samples people have captured. Just needs to be converted.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
I wouldn't bet on that. The machines are designed to be networked together. Some even have integrated iot style lte radios for cellular communication.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
Nothing preventing you from copying your cup, making a new tag with a slightly different ID and scan without limit.

I highly doubt the machines are networked in a way to know which cups are valid or not, must be a range of IDs
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
This would work *if* they aren't using the tag's serial number as an authentication mechanism, which might just be the case. Read the tag's data field, write it to another tag, Sadly, there are no magic cards for UHF *yet.*  So, if you did open the machine, What would you do with it?

My goal would to clone the manager card, which would let you into the advanced menus. 

No clue if either of these would let you refill a cup though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
They use UHF tags, the flipper doesn't have the hardware to read these. 

If you had a UHF reader, you could read the tags of unused cups, and write them to blank tags. The only thing that might stop you would be if they use the tag's serial number, and not the data.

Not even a Proxmark 3 can read UHF tags, so you'd need a dedicated UHF reader, which don't come cheap. The cool thing about them is, with a good antenna, a UHF reader can read tags from 10 to 50 feet away!  (this is how toll passes for vehicles work) I have 2 handheld ones based on Windows CE portable computers, and I can read tags from about 20 feet away.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
What you could do is clone the individual syrup boxes which also have nfc tags on them to open up the service door on the bottom where the syrups are and you could cause it to pop open with the flipper acting like sprite lol

1 hour delay between each refill and its associated with that specific tag, so yes you can refill another persons cup but still within the rules of the park
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
I guess if you can copy your own cup, you can get refill on another cup for another person... 

I'm more interested in what the cup uses though.

The tags are all individual and limit use of the machine, dont see how it would be very beneficial but Im sure you can copy them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
Did your Flipper find all the keys?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
That's not a Flipper's issue. That's a MS' issue for not integrate U2F, which they won't because they want to develop and charge for their own authentication method.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
You'd need a hybrid AD joined machine, as MS does not support Security Keys for logging w/ Windows Hello natively.  There may be third party apps that extend this capability, but it's not natively supported for home/pro and I do t think it's on the road map.

1 : 2022-06-06
Although it's not bruteforcing, it's just working through an existing list of known keys. If your card has been provisioned by a half-competent party, it'll use a key that they generated and nobody else knows, and then an attempt to copy the card will fail.

The "Run compatible app" option is a shortcut to the Special Action specific to your card type. In your case, it tries to brute-force the keys of the encrypted sectors on your card. It might take up to ~40min to read the whole card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
The "compatible app" is just emulating it.  It's probably not an implemented function.

There are certain hardware limitations related to Mifare Classic emulation. 

And there's massive R&amp;D work behind this feature's current implementation - NFC controller's docs do not cover that mode at all.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
Im Running the latest unleashed. I might roll it back to stock to try.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
last versions of flipper firmware are able to fully emulate mifare classic
it is extremely unreliable though :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-06
If the install is even vaguely competent, the cards will have the important data locked in a secure block with a key that isn't publicly known. All flipper can do is run through the list of known/leaked keys in the dictionary, and if it's not in there you're out of luck unless you can crack the card through other means.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
I think it uses a different protocol. This stuff is better tracked on the forums.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
Would this method work for Genie garages as well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
It's likely the work card has data on it that the reader is looking for, whereas flipper just emulates the UID (the card's serial number). Without the data being sent, it won't work. 

I'm not sure if there are plans to implement a full card clone, or if flipper's hardware even can.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
That's pretty nifty actually thx

You could always try pulling the casing off and giving it a bit of paint!

Putting paint on plastic like this isn't the easiest thing in the world, but it's definitely doable with the right prep and and paint.

&gt; No you cant write to amiibos- the tags they use dont allow writing to them.

Not entirely true! They do actually have a small amount of memory for writing - You can't write a new Amiibo to them, but they do allow a few different functions like saves and character data. For example, you can bring your amiibo into Smash Ultimate, train that Ai fighter, and then save that data back to the Amiibo, which can then be read by another Switch - even if the other switch isn't online(and thus pulling from a database elsewhere), and has never seen the original "writing" device.

I've read some fine, but others don't come up at all... and of the ones that do scan, only about half can be emulated successfully... is this due to some sort of security?

If the 'add to cart' button is there and you are in the US, you can order.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
It works for me.

As Security+ uses rolling code, the proper way is to Add Manually the Security+ (LiftMaster), and then follow the garage door opener manual, add a new remote (your flipper). Usually it's pressing the Learn button while pressing Emulate on Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
It's in stock for the US right now. Ignore the Sold out Header and Info section.

Thanks!  
FYI the Android app is crashing after installing this update...  
Is there any way around it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
Yes it was and it said that there was 1000 left and that for some reason it was saying sold out and they said ignore the sold out and just order and you would be fine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
Treadstock.com is the site I have used about 8 times now. Super easy, upload files, pick whatever filament and color you want and it will give you a list of all the people that offer everything you picked. You pick whatever person you want to make it and within like a week it's in the mail.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
You're right about ignoring the out of stock warning, judge me if you wish but I just put a order for one.
Was it on the official discord you heard about the 1000 units?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
Nothing happened. The red LED on the garage just keeps blinking - nothing registers.

I did!  Still hasn't shipped though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
It's for the U.S if I'm not mistaken. Since they are a U.S company they were able to ship out a second extra batch for the people here that should all be shipped this month according to their op on discord.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
I they just sent out another round to the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
I dont know if it is still going but I read on discord that you can ignore the out of stock warning. There was 1000 units still for sale on 06/03/22

Follow discord for updates! That is how I got my hands on 1 last week!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-05
I didn't think of that. That's actually a good idea. If I try I'll let you know how it turns out

In short, turns out he wasn't on the call, and that the companies contacted(Primarily Texas instruments, but including the credit card companies via the Smart Card Alliance) were willing to go through with it, it was actually Discovery/Beyond Productions that pulled out unprompted.

First off thanks! Youre helping this become a better device! 

Youll want to get started by installing the latest version of the firmware. From there youll want to read the opener at 390MHz or 315. Save the reading and upload it to the link in the description. Thats where the dev team primarily operates for this kind of feedback. 

You should also do a raw recording where you press the button 10 times. Save and upload that too.

Because it doesn't have the keys. NFC isn't just dumb memory; think of it as a server running applications that you send requests to. If you can't prove you know the keys (think password, not encryption) then the card simply won't give you the data you're asking for.

I may have simplified that down just a bit. :)

In reality, the credit card doesn't ever transmit the secret, only proof that it knows the secret and it's computationally infeasible to guess the secret from the proof.  The exact method varies by payment network, but if you need a real-world analog imagine this:

    ...
    Card: I'm a SuperCard with name 1234.
    Reader: Okay, here's a combination lockbox #343182 that only SuperCard 1234 can open.  Inside is my favorite animal.
    Card: Okay, here's the unlocked #343182 combination lockbox and your favorite animal is a giraffe.
    Reader: Word.  Giraffes are cool. Hey, SuperCard 1234 unlocked my lockbox and told me my favorite animal, they're cool.
    Payment Network-&gt;Bank: Cool beans.  Let them buy that donut.
    (And, of there's also the same secret exchange between reader and payment network, and the payment network and the bank)

The actual combination is never transmitted, and rests solely on the card.  Down the line, if you try to tell a different reader the combination to lockbox #343182 and their favorite animal was a giraffe, they'd know you overheard the earlier conversation were just repeating it.  Because that reader didn't use the same lockbox and its favorite animal is a badger.

Using your example, whats preventing Flipper from being able to copy the secret only you know off of the credit card?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-04
Thanks 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-04
You can emulate the card announcement, but your flipper can not emulate any of the further communication necessary for a transaction because it lacks the keys stored inside your card.

Basically, the conversation goes like this

    Reader: Here's some power.  What's up?
    Flipper: Hi!  I'm a Credit Card!  My name is 1234 5678 9012 3456
    Reader: Okay, tell me a secret only you know.
    Flipper: Hi!  I'm a Credit Card!  My name is 1234 5678 9012 3456
    Reader: Try again.
    Flipper: Hi!  I'm a Credit Card!  My name is 1234 5678 9012 3456
    Reader: Nevermind.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-04
I came here to say this. This is why the credit card companies got rid of the "Pay Pass" stuff but then brought it back once they had better security. My Flipper can still copy the credit card info off my credit cards easily, but it's not able to successfully emulate the credit card at the point of sale, either because the Flipper is not picking up all the encrypted information or because the security at the terminal knows it's not a credit card.

The old (like 25 years ago old) cardless fobs were simple RFID devices and easily spoofed.  Mobil's Speedpass was probably the most widespread that I remember, but Visa and MasterCard also did use RFID fobs for a bit approximately the same time, but I don't remember it lasting very long.

According to this post , they are still available if the add cart button is enabled. Take it for what its worth. Im sure youll get one either way, it just may be a bit of a wait if its actually just adding to a back order or something.

For the keycard youll need to:
- learn which technology the card uses
- if it uses a mifare classic chip you might be interested on understanding how some cryptographic algorithms, Cypto1 / DESfire. http://www.cs.ru.nl/~flaviog/publications/Talk.Mifare.pdf
- Mfuc might work with flipper in case it is compatible with libnfc, that might be a good tool for you to play with. (Dont know yet if it works because I havent received my flipper yet, and Im a backer)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-04
Go and read all the blog posts, make note of the underlying technology and learn about it, then go and checkout the GitHub repositories and do the same. Good luck.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-04
Yea I want to learn more so HOW the device works and its functions 

More so I want to learn the fundamentals, if maybe you have any ideas or resources.

For example one thing I want to do with it is learn how to clone my keycard for work.

BUT I want to learn the nitty gritty of HOW this works and WHY IT WORKS. Not just learn to do it.

I understand these type of things can be a rabbit hole but I just want to learn where to start understand these type of things.

Absolutely. You can also build partial packages containing only radio stack (in case you'd need a different one) or SD card resources. And keep them on your Flipper to instal on-the-go.

I tried this and it didn't work, did you capture the signal live?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Yeah its awesome when you don't have to buy them all
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Yea, I figured something along those lines since it also turns on a light when open.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
According to comments on Discord, it closes in 15-30 seconds
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Security+ 2.0 TX works great!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Oh wow thats impressive I didnt expect that much at all with it being able to do so much
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Why is that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
I concur, I ran it for 5-6 days and only got down to around 50%.

That combined with the lovely USB-C to easily charge with generic cables whenever needed, leads me to say that adding a bigger battery would be much more trouble than its worth.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't the charging door close itself after a certain amount of time? I've sniped a few parked but it's usually closed again when I pass by 15 min later.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Somerset County here!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Cool stuff! Found it on eBay, too (significantly cheaper with shipping to Norway). I'm giving it 70/30 odds of arriving before my Flipper...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Love the ability to update from the mobile app!  Well done Flipper Team!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
wicked!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Cool 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Hey so where would a person that knows some it stuff but never did any pentesting be able to locate resources to gain the knowledge to do this and similar things? 

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
If you havent scripted or coded I can imagine itd be daunting. There are some forked versions of the firmware (That dont think we can link to) that are compiled with these third party plugins developed by the community.  I believe some are listed and linked in that awesome flipper repo. They probably even include the file necessary to perform a firmware install.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
You wouldn't need a Flipper for that. It would be just a few lines of code in your programming language of choice.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Fair enough
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Dang, guess it just hates me then
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Of course I can push a button, of course I can carry all my garage remotes, of course I can put all my keyfobs on one chain. There is nothing a flipper can do, that cannot be done by regular means, but whats the fun in that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Fair enough.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Orders from the recent US restock have not shipped yet, you will get a tracking number when that occurs. They also pre-authorize your card when you order but this authorization may roll off. Closer to shipping they will post the actual charge to your account.

People internal at Flipper have said in the Discord they will likely be in our hands by the end of the month but there is no additional information beyond that. Just wait, you will get your tracking number.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Cant discuss illegal firmware here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
That's strange. The site did say out of stock. But you should have been able to place an order.
-------------------------------

Thats still pretty cool
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Ok
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
There are many systems that only check the UID of the card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
I just Laughed out loud
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Yeah they said they're preparing my order. But didn't give me an eta.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Are you from the US?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Out of curiosity, what is the use if only UID can be emulated?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
5 days ago? I wasn't even able to place an order 5 days ago
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Nonstandard firmware,  we don't talk about it here.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Yes, your last theory should be correct. The box is listening for new signals, and sending one from the flipper should be enough
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
I actually emailed support to make sure my order went through. They said it did and that it was shipping out mid June. I ordered last week.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
I was playing around with that - so I can add manually, then emulate/rename/delete.  When I emulate though, I just see a key and counter that increase every time I hit the button. Is this a brute force way to open the garage, or is there a way to specifically pair the Flipper to the garage door as if it were a real remote? Once I add manually, I don't see a way to learn the code that the box is supposedly sending out.  Or is it that I hit Learn Code on the garage box and then hit Emulate on the Flipper?

Thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Yes, I saw that too. However Im unsure on how to install that on the flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Its so dumb, yet so very satisfying. Ive gotten to the point that I can spot a Tesla from so far away. No Tesla Is Safe!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Maybe. I just put the roguemaster FW on tonight. Ill definitely let you know if anything changes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
No you cant write to amiibos- the tags they use dont allow writing to them. But you can use flipper to read and store your amiibos and then replay them to use on your switch (or whatever console you have).  So you can have your whole amiibo collection right in your pocket on your flipper!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Nevermind I found the info I was asking about, Im gonna do what I can to make it out for the next meeting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Haven't received anything (the Netherlands)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Perhaps your fan remote is infrared
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Where? Ill definitely take a night off. Im pretty good with OSINT and social engineering. Just ok with lock picking. I think meeting up with other people might help me learn and grow faster than just doing labs and CTFs by myself. Id love to come to some meetings.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Hey how do you put tetris on it, mine had snake to boot but theres a couple of files idk how to port. Main ones being .fmf and whatever the game ones are
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Turn it off, lock it, when dumb mode is a thing put it in dumb mode
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Wait what you can put stuff on amiibos
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Just tried the updated RC firmware but same issue (same issue with just release too) Here's what I'm currently on:


Firmware: 0.59.1-RC


Hardware: 12.F7B9C6


Radio FW: 1.13.3
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Okay. I did see that. 2-3 weeks. 

Some of the confusion was because the website said out of stock, but I was able to complete my order. So I wasn't sure if that was accurate.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Same reason many ceiling fans come with radio remotes, wiring those switches up in an existing build would be tedious.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Wow I don't think I've ever seen these in Australia but, as a wheelchair user that just got a flipper I'm super keen to try exploit these as reaching those buttons can be a real pain.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
Perfect, thanks so much for the answer!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
No, we've come to a conclusion that emulating LibNFC would be basically impossible to implement due to the hardware limitations of the st25r3916 chip that we use, the same problem as with the Mifare Classic emulation
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
There's an Add Manually option in the Subghz menu. If your flipper can read the signal, it will show the type. Select that type in the Add Manually menu and you're good to go
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
What FW version are you on right now?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
The battery lasts a really really long time already
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
The ETA is shown on the checkout after calculating your delivery cost.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
That's because you have non re-writeable cards. The flipper will show the success message if hex on the card = hex to be written, so if you're trying to write the same thing that is on the card, it will think it has successfully written to it. You need T5577 cards to write to them.

In the awesome flipper zero repo I see a mouse jiggler app. Did you try that? https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-03
My initial thought was using badusb but I'm pretty sure that one limitation of badusb is that none of the scripts are loopable so if you wanted a jiggler for a specific time you could just copy and paste whatever line would jiggle the mouse a bunch of times but I doubt that's really the solution anyone needs. I would also like to know how to get a mouse jiggler to work on here. Sounds like a good first C project maybe.

Hah! Me, too!  I asked if I could add the cover to my order, but was told that cannot be done.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
No, it just doesn't work. The receiver is likely "off" or not listening when the car is in motion
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I KNOW.  I was just asking. I'm not diminishing your suffering.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Yes, that is the case. Car has to be stopped, in park and "turned off".
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Does anyone know if you attempt to do this to a Tesla in motion if the driver gets any sort of alert or notice?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Yeah, it still works. Unless, sentry mode is off and it is in hibernation mode.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
5 days, lol that is cute, the rest of us have waited YEARS.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I guess what I mean is if it's "turned off". As is not driving and no one in the car.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Yep. I was ready to wait when I was ordering flipper. I just hope it will be just few months.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
We're receiving the excess stock after the preorders were filled, I believe. Is that your impression too?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I ordered those too. Separately, because I'm an idiot and like paying double for shipping.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
They don't shut off.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I ordered the rubber protector and WiFi dev board a month ago they said it will ship in a few weeks. No biggie
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I'm in the same boat. Since only half of the original preorders we're shipped I think we may get our devices next year.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Is it only possible to open it while the car is completely off?

If you know the person there's a nice prank where you say something like "Did you hear about all the battery problems that these things are having? You can tell if you have a bad battery because your fuel door will randomly pop open!"   That's a $14,000 fix.

Is it possible for me to try reflashing the out of box version of the firmware to test?


or is warranty of some sort maybe an option? I know you guys would be super busy so happy to wait until the kickstarter stuff is finished off if thats an option. Or do you think it would purely be a software issue? 


Thanks for getting back to me here before, I know how busy you guys must be right now!

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I'm super new but still not sure how to do this. It looks like I'm supposed to go to the garage door box, hit "learn code" and then if I had a real remote, I'd hit the button on the remote to pair it.  I'm not sure what that translates to on the Flipper because nothing comes up under the frequency analyzer, Read, or even Read RAW. Any tips? I know the frequency because I did manage to pick up the remote signal with the frequency analyzer, so that's about as far as I got.

But the manufacturer does have a responsibility (again depending on where you live) to have a reasonable prevention measures (which of course, its not expected that it be impossible to crack, but a series of what, 3 button pushes? To break the law with their device would be clear negligence), of which an easy to lie question is not. A more extreme example is that a manufacturer cant put 80 tons of explosives in a car and add a detonate button and say well the user is solely responsible to not push this button on the highway.

The key safety for flipper here is that while this lock can be cracked, it cant be done in some way that a toddler could accidentally do it, it requires actual intent and diverging from the official firmware to do so.

Same here (Netherlands), backer number below 1500.. 

Patience finally pays off! Already printed the pelican-case and did some dumpster diving for a microSD card and lanyard.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I suppose so, but why would they go about implementing this capability that could be used for a negligence claim (depending on where you are in the world) when its simpler to just assume the region of use is the region the flipper is mailed to and handle it that way? It just doesnt really seem practical to ask the user from a legal or software point of view when they can just send flippers that follow AU codes to the AU and US codes to the US. What people do beyond that point is their liability as any modification to the region lock takes clear intent to circumvent the lock (by loading or compiling a modified firmware, an action that the flipper does not technically support but the individuals in the company have hinted you should do)

The flipper team was also very generous with the region lock only being software based. It wouldnt have been hard to hardcode a small chip on the flipper that dictates its region and locks frequencies based off this which would have required physical modding to get around the flipper team told us day one that they had to do this but would make it software based (and at least somewhat implied that it wouldnt be super difficult to bypass).

I mean, I suppose were just talking in circles at this point. Could the flipper team have made it stupid simple to bypass the region locks? Yeah probably, but again, Im certain parts of the world that could have gotten them in trouble. Could the flipper team have made it incredibly difficult to bypass the region lock? Yeah, they could have but they made a conscious decision not to. Is it particularly hard to bypass the region lock now? No not really, but it requires a computer and a small bit of know how (or at least the capability of reading a readme) and it cant be bypassed with the flipper alone which is the key argument.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Of course. But it is not the manufacturer's responsibility to ensure that the users don't lie about where they are. All they have to do is ask the question - if the user lies about where they are, opening up frequencies outside of what is legal in that region, then the user is solely responsible for that, not the manufacturer.

The SD card has a dolphin folder containing all of the different scenes. You can see their source and a description of the text files [here](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/tree/dev/assets/dolphin).

The images need to be converted and compressed. I ripped the file2icon function out of [this](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/scripts/flipper/assets/icon.py) script instead of getting the entire asset packaging system going. You'll need ImageMagick installed and compile [heatshrink](https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink) to make it work.

I wish there was a way to debug the animations without recompiling the firmware. You can remove all the other entries in /ext/dolphin/manifest.txt. that way only your custom animation and the built in TV one will come up. Rebooting picks one at random.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
Holy shit. Nicely done
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
I mean, if you could select your own region, people would just lie about their region to use frequencies illegal in their region.

As far as I know, the flipper will be set for the region it has been mailed to. If you are in Australia, you should have the legal Australia frequencies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
It'd be nice if the software let you select what region you are in and adjust/remove the restrictions as needed.

I'm in Australia. A device locked to US frequency ranges may well be illegal for me to operate here.

The "Select a Region" route was what PC-based DVD players used to do to region lock themselves (with a limited number of changes before they were "permanently" locked).

I had that happen once. Force restarted, did it again, all was fine. I've also had mine not reboot properly a few times after updating but the firmware took fine. Updates should take only a few minutes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-02
So this also implies if you have multiple firmwares on your SD card that support this feature, you could swap between them using only the flipper. That's actually pretty cool.

So this also implies if you have multiple firmwares on your SD card that support this feature, you could swap between them using only the flipper. That's actually pretty cool.

Often the button is just a wireless transmitter that talks to the automatic door opening mechanism. This is much easier and cheaper to install than running wire from outside the building to the door mechanism.

They can be triggered by a remote? That's so confusing.

A button on the outside wall of a building which triggers an automatic door which allows someone in a wheelchair to enter. Theyre common in the US because federal law requires any public building to comply with certain handicapped accessibility rules.

...and none of that is handicapped triggers, and none of that will ever be enforced.

Sometimes you can see a little pigtail antenna on top of the automatic door opener that receives the wireless signal from the paddle
-------------------------------

You still don't seem to get it....

If your device transmits on a frequency it was not designed and registered for, it's illegal. 

If you transmit too much power on a frequency that isn't allowed, that's illegal. 

If you transmit on a frequency you think is clear and it interferes with another legal signal, that's illegal. 

There is a very slim chance of you getting in trouble as the FCC is rather limited to enforce this stuff but it's still against the law.

Unfortunately I didn't remember to note down what flipper said they were before I updated. But here is what my phone reports them as:


One is a Mifare Classic, the other is a "NXP - Mifare Plus". Both still read fine in other readers I have but for some reason flipper now won't detect them at all. 


The 3rd was a bank card (via the read bank card function). Same deal, worked fine pre-update but not anymore.

A reddit thread is a private forum on a private company's non-public servers. 

I don't see how someone even discussing illegal ways to mod something is any of their legal responsibility.  I don't think anything would ever hold up in court as their fault. It's like suing Ford for someone modding their accelerator pedal and it sticking.  

Will they privately, since it's their subreddit and  be conservative? Sure. It's their choice.  I don't think it really matters though.  It won't take reddit for enough tesla owners to go berserk and the flipper becoming more hated by the public and then "banned".
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
OK, let me clarify.  Frequencies along the bands meant for the public.

You absolutely ARE allowed to transmit to your hearts content on all these frequencies that are meant for it. No one is ever ever ever ever going to be fined or jailed for opening up a handicap door.

I didn't say busting into a HAM frequency and transmitting without a license, I meant for the context of this thread where we are discussing open sourced triggers for wireless things in the environment.   NOT cloning Apt entry badges, NOT sniffing wifi passwords, but all those ceiling fan things that we are talking about here. 

No, you CAN'T get in trouble for that.  We aren't discussing private-licensed FCC frequencies in this instance.

I install them for a living. 90% are 9v battery powered. The frequency will differ from button to button, there are dip switches inside to change the rx/tx freq so that more than one can be in close proximity.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
Put those files in to the infrared folder on the sd card and run them. If it doesn't work, then maybe your tv model is different
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
So I just put those codes right? I still dont understand cause I did that the other day but no luck
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
Unlicensed bands or not doesn't mean just any transmitter can transmit.

Not quite that I agree with all of it but people aren't really wrong.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
I don't know where you speak for but in America you can absolutely be arrested and face very large fines from the FCC for illegal transmissions on "public radio frequencies."

There are no such things as "public radio frequencies" here. Every single bit of spectrum has a long list of rules regarding it down to having to have most transmitters "type certified."

Had a chance to handle a broken one the other week. It runs off of a 9 volt battery and it's frequency range is 389.4 MHz - 390.4 MHz. It should be within the range of the Flipper's CC1101 chip.

Here is the FCC ID and some info: https://fccid.io/OHRTX323/

Let me know if you learn anything about it's encoding.

[UberGuidoz](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper) has files for handi-doors under the SubGhz folder. Haven't tried them yet, but there they are.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
There are 1024 codes under the specification as it allows a single code to control a single door without interfering with others that may be nearby. 

But yes, the ADA has required new installations after 2017 must support remote triggering. Previous installations are grandfathered as long as they remain open at least 5 seconds from activation.
-------------------------------

Did you get your flipper on ebay or from the flipper store? Sounds like the former, since it had some other firmware. I assume the AC folder is still there (you can check the SD card directly), but the official fw does not support folders yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01

Ok this uber moderation is getting out of control. There is NOTHING illegal about transmitting on public radio frequencies whatsover.  The mods need to chill, no one cares about "illeeegul" stuff. Cops won't be bothered to get out of their lazyboys and arrest anyone anyway so who cares. There is no internet police waiting in the wings for a mod to let non-standard firmware be downloaded.  You're out of high school stop being hall monitors.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-06-01
Not sure sorry, I didn't think to note it down, it didn't have any codes but had the folder option.

Yes, you can change there name that is displayed, but the "name" is just a more human readable serial number.

Is it PII? I mean, you would have to go pretty far to get anything useful from it...

First, get someone's name from a post. 

Second, pwn the store that sells the flippers.

Pwn the factory and order fulfillment systems to link the name you got to who ordered it.

Profit?
-------------------------------

You cant change the name thats hard-coded into the OTP. By changing the firmware you simply dont look the name up.

Howdy, I'm still seeing a lock icon when I use Read via the Sub-GHz Unlocked for my Garage Remote, which is 433.92Mhz (KeeLoq 64bit). Does this mean that it's just not possible to emulate? I have more info if you send me a DM.

This means that the card's keys are not in the dictionary that flipper uses. You have to perform a more advanced attack (nested/hardnested) to recover them, and the flipper doesn't have enough computational power to run it, so you'll need something like proxmark3

Took me a while too. Turns out the frequency analyser is only short range. I find the best way is to open it with the flipper nearby the device I'm trying to analyse and then hold the trigger button.

Right but again, that's Bluetooth. Nobody is going to be filing a police report because you updated your firmware for your device over Bluetooth.

Even if someone did know your device's name, it doesn't transmit it's name when you play any of the signals. It doesn't send any kind of ID unique to it, actually. So even if someone did discover that there was a malicious signal in the area, simply the knowledge of your ownership of a flipper, and even the name of your flipper, wouldn't prove it was you in court. They'd need something like a video of you holding your flipper (or any device, for that matter) out and pressing a button on it and causing their garage (or whatever it is) to open. Even then, it wouldn't matter if it's your device or if they know your device's name, because they have incriminating evidence, the type of which you cannot get by simply knowing the name of someone's flipper device, of you causing the signal to be transmitted, regardless of the utilized device and who it belongs to. The name you've chosing isn't nearly as big of a deal as lots of people are making it out to be. In fact, it's no deal at all. Feel free to share your flipper names freely. I'm definitely not encouraging illicit activities here, just making it clear that you're not going to cause any kind of issue for yourself if you tell people the name of your device, regardless of what you choose to do with it.

Based on that list of vehicle manufacturers, do you happen to be in Aus? haha. I tried with my 2009 Hyundai and it worked the first time, but not after that (presumably because that code had already been used). I'd love a backup key on my flipper, because I lose my keys all the time .
-------------------------------

There is encryption on the card. To fully emulate the card you need a private key from your bank.

No, I just meant that people would like it better if the name was genericised so anybody could send it. I think the name is randomised when you wipe the device although I havent done that yet.

Compiling and installing firmware is documented and pretty easy once you install Docker/docker-compose. (See https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware#build-with-docker)

What's hard is actually firguring out the APIs and adding to the firmware.

dude, i dont care that i had to update it. thats not what i said, it was that you cant update it without an SD card. when i backed ages ago the SD card was still in the works if they would put one in or not. i saw they were putting 1 in but missed the part that an SD card would be a mandatory part of it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
no problem. and yea that's the tool  tried lol Could be because I'm using a very stripped down Ubuntu VM for a dev box. I'm trying to heavily restrict what's on it to reduce potential conflicts.  
Also redid the formatting for the wiki so it parses the headers properly. It's permanently at [https://docs404.com/en/hardware/flipper-zero/flipper-zero-doc](https://docs404.com/en/hardware/flipper-zero/flipper-zero-doc) now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
No I just meant that for me for some reason it has been as simple as pulling up to my work truck and whipping out my flipper with the press of one button  I truelly don't know what I've done to make it work however.

Thanks.  


For what it's worth that was just after finishing a fresh minimal install of 20.04, so there really shouldn't be any additional steps outside of "install ubuntu 20" to get to the end of the guides.  


I want to dig into the CLI a bit more I just have too much on my plate. From what I've seen so far it's pretty watered down. Like I can tell it to scan for an NFC device, and it'll dump a short summary when it's detected, but I can't tell it to dump the full data to a file like I can from the physical interface. Least I haven't seen how it can be done.  


As far as the docs404 wiki goes, I have no idea what it's gonna be, but if you end up wanting to contribute to the docs, let me know :)

Been screwing with ubuntu all day to build base images.

Virtual box really used to be much better. That is a good write up. I meant I need to setup the development environment.

Now I am curious because I had no idea there was a CLI interface for the flipper. Now I want to see what all that can do.

How is it on the contrary? Did I say the wrong thing? I mentioned emulating key fobs with the Flipper, and it sounds like that's what you have done. Congratulations. That is not brute force.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Unfortunately I had the same problem, although it's not pinched wires but an actual battery fault in my case.  I got a response after a few days, but nothing since.  I guess I'll wait a few more days
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Oddly enough, on the contrary. For the 6 different branded and aged vehicles at the factory I have able to record raw code from the key fobs and open the vehicles without any issues.

I did record a number of times for each fob and noticed that the codes repeat, but what would happen if you pressed the button jn your pocket while too far away from the vehicle? I guess the rolling codes didn't have to be order, and I was correct.
We have fords, VWs, Suzuki's, Toyota's, and Holden's. Oh and an fpv. Some are original central locking, while others have after market central locking with alarms, and all work.

Right but there is no easy worthwhile way for the flipper team to verify the legitimacy of a sub-ghz transmission license in every single region they mail flippers to. This is why they blanket block all the frequencies illegal for the average consumer to broadcast on. The issue with end users having these licenses and being able to legally transmit on frequencies that are generally illegal to transmit on is really niche in the scope of their target audience and there isnt really a convenient way for them to solve it. Even if the team had a pipeline for verifying your specific license and granting your specific flipper access to the frequencies you are allowed to use, it would have to be in the form of a custom firmware that allows the flipper to broadcast on those frequencies as they are blocked at the firmware level.

That is why regardless of if its the answer you wanted, the only real way for you to accomplish what you are requesting would be to install one of the modded firmwares. If you want help with that, you can DM me about it as we arent allowed to link to them here due to their ability to give the flipper the potential to break the law by adding the capability to broadcast on illegal frequencies.

I suppose the only other way would be for you to build your own custom sub-ghz modual and control it separately via the GPIO on the flipper, but at that point you are not using the flipper hardware and you might as well just have made a more compact sub-ghz controller.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
They would be manufacturer specific and likely only available to techs working on them in the field and their developers, I would be hard pressed to imagine someone made a library as a third party.

1 : 2022-05-31
What's blocked isn't the same as what's illegal.

There are frequencies it's legal for me to transmit on but are blocked by the Flipper firmware.  I have absolutely no interest in risking my license transmitting on frequencies I don't have privileges on, but for the ones I do it'd be nice to be able to do it from my Flipper since it's more compact than my HT.   Without having to replace the entire firmware.

1 : 2022-05-31
Well the problem here is those frequencies may never be available via the official firmware as if they are blocked, its because its illegal to broadcast on those frequencies in your region.

The other firmwares are not as much third party firmwares as much as  they are modded versions of the original firmware to disable these blocks. The common ones are also open source and on GitHub so you can parse the code and make sure that the code hasnt been made malicious before you build it. That is the really your only way to broadcast on these frequencies unless you make a mod for the firmware yourself, as it will never be an official update unless the laws in your region change.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Yea, I just get kind of sketchy about third-party firmware on something capable of so much wireless communication and having to call it to my callsign which is linked to my real name and home address, so I'll just wait until the firmware is more mature and poke at it then.

Just a pain to go through the whole self-compiling rigmarole every single update rather than just be able to have a file outside the firmware that says "here's my callsign, prepend it to everything in these frequency ranges where it's legal to operate"

Do you have sub files or are they unique? I tried a couple but couldn't get them to work. TIA

Coinbase Visa cards are easy to read. Mifare classic looks like it functions but it doesn't. It can read a NFC by the bits, but emulation fails, and it doesn't display the data I loaded on it. Works great for turning off televisions, or helping a Tesla car owner open the charging port door on their ride. Frankly we are all lucky to have the hardware given the current conditions and situations in the world. Moving forward it's open source, kind of an all-in-one and I think it will only get better, especially as more owners start tinkering around with their devices. I'm looking forward to the day where I can personally and easily edit the firmware myself and upload it through say Arduino vs how they do it now which is far as I know is an undocumented complex process. Maybe fall or winter of this year it will be more user friendly and customizable. Just a guess, but the developers haven't quit which is awesome.
-------------------------------

There is unofficial firmware that can do illegal things. It is not supported here but a Google search should point you in the right direction. Although my original question was more about rolling codes in general and not the unleashed firmware. The deleted comment only said that to talk about it at all is breaking the rules, which it is not. Linking to it would break the rules.

It was my assumption from googling that even if rolling codes are recorded and replayed, it doesn't matter because a reused code is ignored. This post is implying that there is a way to crack these rolling codes and use them normally or something. Unless the vehicle key fobs OP is using don't use rolling codes? I was under the impression that the illegal firmware could only replay rolling codes, and wasn't able to "crack" them.
-------------------------------

There is different firmware (made by other users) out there that does allow certain things to be done. In order to do those things, restrictions are bypassed which makes it possible to use the device in unlicensed ways. This is not supported here, they do not want any legal ramifications from those who chose to modify the device (which they own) in that manner.

You need am SD card because the whole storage space on the Flipper zero is just 1MB. Databases and update files simply cannot fit inside the ~100kb left after the firmware is installed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
This means that the signal uses a dynamic key protocol and cannot be saved or sent because of that.

It's a case of manufacturing needing firmware at the beginning of production, long before any customer receives it.

That firmware needs to have enough functionality for QA testing and to allow users to update after receiving it, but usually significant development is done while manufacturing is happening, so there's no way for the units to have the latest firmware on them before shipping, without an *extremely* expensive and labour intensive process of pulling every device individually out of their boxes and doing the update. You don't do that unless there's a really critical bug that can't be resolved any other way! Far easier and more efficient to just get each user to update their device as soon as they get it - which they'll want to do anyway.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
We talk about the 'flipperclub' all the time on the discord server!

 I don't think I'm allowed to link to the unleashed firmware on Github, that you definitely shouldn't take the .dfu from, and certainly don't use the qflipper app to flash it "from file" on your FZ. don't Do that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Hence I never asked here, assumed it wasn't allowed him here since we don't talk about flipperclub.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
It's probably the second one. It's not legal for the FZ to broadcast certain frequencies depending on the country, so THE DEFAULT firmware restricts you from doing so. Flipper takes no responsibility if you were to change the firmware to allow your device to broadcast on those frequencies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
I meant enough to use the basic stuff. Being unable to put a database or firmware update with an sd card seems odd. But grabbing an sd card is no issue as I had planned to get one anyway.

I've seen this in my expeditions with the FZ. I assumed it was a security lock/hopping thing that wasn't supported yet or it's going to be something we can't talk about in here.

They don't necessarily care about the conditions in the cargo bay. But they *are* bags that can contain significant chemical energy, so airlines would rather they stay in the cabin where a fire is obvious and can be detected and contained quickly. You can guarantee flight attendants have equipment and training specifically for battery fires.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Well yeah. So I can't just put a link of firmwares in here for you. But there are firmwares that allow more frequency and rolling codes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
"You"? I have nothing to do with the project.

Secondly, this is US stock that was already (over)produced. Due to regional laws around radio frequencies, there are 3 different versions. They couldn't legally ship these to non-US regions even if they wanted to.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
There is some internal storage; it just doesn't ship with the databases installed. You'll need an SD card for the firmware update process anyway.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
I see 3 rules, and one simply says "no links to forked firmware" am I missing something?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
We cant link to them in this sub, but there are a number of modded firmwares that will allow operation within the blocked frequencies.

Not right now. Someone needs to program one up. It is still early days for the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-31
Well, within the flipper's range, but blocked in some places because it's "illegal."

Which is kind of annoying because I do have operating privileges in a lot of range that they've deemed "illegal."  I wish there was a way to fix that.  I'll just have to wait until the firmware settles down and I'm sure someone (or maybe I'll dig in) and expand the ranges to the full legal operating range.

My Playstation remotes have been bluetooth since the PS3.

1 : 2022-05-31
Ugh, we're not really a nanny state. The flipper hardware is entirely legal, as it only transmits in bands that already have an appropriate class license (also why you need the appropriate region version of the device.) It can be used illegally, but then so can a brick.
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Care to elaborate? Nothing's perfect, but the Comms manager did say on another comment that they're at least using the secure enclave to encrypt the U2F info stored on the SD card. And open-source firmware for transparency or if you want to make any improvements.

I mean I probably wouldn't trust entirely just because the flipper does so much stuff, especially communicating with other things, whereas a simple token that does nothing else will have smaller attack surface. Just curious what your reasoning is.

From Canada, I ask the same question? How do you upload files to it? Please help an old Vet sort this out "55" LOL. Any information on how to upload to it would be awesome.

Thank you! I didn't know the screen was mirrored with the qflipper app. I was able to use the Flipper Zero this way. I'll try to do this to connect with the app over Bluetooth for mobile use until this gets fixed or replaced.

i'm out in western ma we should make a discord or somethin
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
my biggest problem so far: what exactly do i do with this thing?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Attack? Its a genuine question
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Ok sure. I knew I would get attacked for that comment. Just remember my advice a year from now. 

The flipper has a very different attack surface. My advice stands, take it or dont \_()_/

Do you trust a random $12 key from amazon? Same tech
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
hmmm how come the online shop still allows orders to be placed right now?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
FYI. I wouldnt trust flippers U2F for anything you really want to secure. Its a neat feature, but not something Id trust.

Mine was also damaged but still works. There was a sharp shard of the screen from the bottom corner. I sanded the sharp away and put a piece of clear adhesive vinyl over the top so its functional and no longer a danger to my fingers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
What type of cord did you use? It looks high quality haha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Sorry, correction Oceania.

Same here. I'm pretty sure we are good. I got my confirmation email

First time backing a crowdfunded electronic device? This was a pretty reasonable timeframe for something this complicated, even if the global chip supply chain wasn't currently 100% munted. 

Sure it'd be nice to get something within a month or two but the only reason that happens for regular consumer devices is because they spend a couple of years and a lot of investor seed money doing all the production work before you ever hear of the device. Something niche like this would never have had a chance under that model.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30

I just got some BADUSB scripts injected into my computer - working on writing my own injectable pranks for friends right now,

Got some NFC amiibos loaded on, now I gotta make em work.

Slowly slowly.

Yep, I see. Its just highly unlikely that I'll ever mess up then key stored on the chip. But whipping an sd card is quite realistic
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Both of them are important, without one you can't use the other
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Oh so this is actually the important one. So I guess we can't ever flash the sd card or just need to make backups of that file
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Only in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
It stores all the U2F info (like the individual account keys). The secure enclave key is only used to encrypt and decrypt that file.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
What is the purpose of the U2F file that is stored on the sd card?

The U2F key is stored in the STM32's secure enclave and will not be wiped unless you re-flash the FUS (which you'll probably never do, and if you actually have to - you'll be warned multiple times that it'll erase your keys), and the U2F file (the encrypted storage for your accounts, basically) is stored on the SD card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
I always have my flipper in my pocket, the way I see it, its just another electronic device. Same as a phone. If anyone asks, act as if its a toy (the newest pocket pet from Japan) keep it locked and you should be fine. TSA might ask to test it for GSR but should give it right back(if you dont take it to the gun range or expose it to anything that might show in the test)

Depending on your use case you might find the Broadlink RM4 Pro (IR &amp; 433MHz RF, some regional models also do other RF frequency bands) or Mini (IR only) to be a better fit as these already integrate with home automation systems, either cloud based (e.g. for voice assistants), local control via Home Assistant or various other scripts that can control them. Flipper seems more like something you would take with you, Broadlink more something you would leave in a room with devices you want to control.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Im in Australia and still dont have it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Yeah got mine today too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Me either. It's pretty good though. Already cloned my work access card and worked out tv controls etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Bugger me. I didnt think it would ever happen.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Amazing! you have a knack for design!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Yes I have a whole omg repo just for all my scripts for those devices
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
You may be able to "unpair" the remote for your TV from the TV, then it will fallback onto IR mode then you could copy codes. 

Big maybe but I've seen this before. Maybe not on an LG specifically.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Considering it has a Li-ion battery it should always go in the passenger compartment and not in checked luggage. 

Batteries in a non-pressurized area experiencing wild temperature fluctuations get angry.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Grats guys! Received mine Friday afternoon and have been having so much fun with it already :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Can't wait till there is stock again so I can get one in NZ
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
I got mine in Melbourne on Friday, must've been lucky i guess.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
I guess I got lucky, I was able to read and emulate my access card for work (hid prox card II). Looking forward to more support though and hope it comes soon for you guys if possible!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Just took mine in my carry on on a domestic US trip was not a problem in the least.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
Just got mine in Brisbane.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-30
I can't even remember in which colour I picked mine 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
That's great! When will it support third party firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Tracking had mine out for delivery at 12:30pm, but then back at the depot at 1pm. Damn it contractor, do your job already. :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Flipper, why do you do me this way &gt;_&lt;
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Got mine this morning too in Melbourne. Had to run to Officeworks for a microSD card.

If anyone needs an SD card, the 32GB SanDisk Ultras are on sale on Amazon be sure to price match at OW for 5% off
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Melbourne - Mine arrived too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Getting proper Fomo right now, should have ordered when I had the chance. Congrats and let us know how it goes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Melbourne this morning too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Got super lucky, mine is Mazuki
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Damn that sucks. Apart from opening up and checking soldering or connections, I guess you'd have to send it back for repair or new one..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Thank you. That's what I was thinking, just over thinking sometimes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I'm out of the loop, can you please explain?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
So stream with qflipper over USB and connect to your phone while doing that over BT.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Thanks, might try my hand at dye I guess.  Ordered a white one today!  Anyone know what type of plastic the case is?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Personally I wouldnt worry about it in your carry-on. Its just another electronic device. Turn it off.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Does your power shell for ducky work on the OMG?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Remember friends, SD card before updating!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Sounds like a plan to me - I love Roburrito's.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Thats true. I think the little wrist one you made is the one I really want. Let me know when you have available. Thanks.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I made this with the USB cable that came with the Flipper. I guess I can purchase another short usb-c cable then braid it for you. But I feel like it might not worth the cost.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Im thinking a meet up at Roburritos is in order at some point.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Got mine today as well. Picked up a new sd yesterday as I had a feeling.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Out for delivery today apparently, made sure I chucked a spare SD card in my bag this morning!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I need one of these too!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Noice mate
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I picked mine up on the way to work. Got to fight the urge to open it up 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I can always make a Boston/Cambridge Flipper discord if theres enough interest
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Got another here!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Got mine in Melbourne this morning as well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
My partner sent me a photo of the box. Only 3 more hours left of work. Won't be able to concentrate at work now 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Same just now. But I'm at work woohoo
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Then brute-forcing the reader won't help. It would only work on cards that can already be read and emulated. You can't emulate a card that you can't read.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
My card can't be read at this point
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Delivered in Sydney this morning.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Just got mine this morning in AU
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
You can just read your card. 

The only purpose of brute-forcing via reader is to find the missing byte if you have no physical access to the card, only visual info
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Kickstarter only.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Black was only for Kickstarter! Enjoy!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Thanks! Just ordered mine! Couldnt pick a color but just glad I can get one.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
13 minutes is fine for a lot of us who are just looking to copy our own keys
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Sounds perfectly viable to me. Relatively speaking, 13min is nothing. 

But I got the answer to my question: its not implemented, we gonna write our one plugins
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
More like 13 minutes  


13 minutes of standing next to the reader and hearing it beep constantly
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Its just one byte, so how long can it be..? 30 seconds? 1 minute?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Brute-forcing it would not be viable due to the fact that the reader beeps for a few seconds after reading every incorrect code, so brute-forcing will be **really** slow.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
All I read said that the white ones that are about the size of a credit card aren't (yet) supported.

I don't know enough to tell you more. Sorry!

I did try using the numbers on my card in various ways though, but no luck
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
The article says that the most popular HID protocol is supported. So maybe our cards are just on a different protocol. The question is, if we know all 3 bytes and manually input them, does the protocol even matter..?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I also have a hid card, and as of last week, I couldn't figure it out. Read a lot and it seems they're just not supported yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Yo guys, count me in as well!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Yep mine arrived in Sydney this morning. Pumped!
-------------------------------

Mine arrived in Sydney this morning
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
You still looking? I have one New Open box with wifi addon board.  $399

I'm finding I am doing more 3d Printing than playing with the Flipper. 

So new printer it is.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Same!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
It just depends 

The plug is really cool to just carry on your Keychain and it's the one I use for demos and such. 
It doesn't have keylogging capabilities and hold just 8 saved payloads and no self destruct feature. But using it for demos you don't really need that 

While the keylogging cable is getting an update very soon that will allow it to hold up to 800 payloads if you wanted 
Now that's way more than you need but for me being someone who is constantly developing new payloads it will be amazing 

So they both have their perks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Which OMG cable or plug do you recommend most?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Yes absolutely 
While technically you don't need the programmer that is what you use to upgrade it once new firmware comes out. 
Kalani is the one who pushes new updates and probably at least twice a month he'll put out a new firmware. 

Also you didn't hear this from me but they are about to release one of their biggest firmware updates ever. The new features they have coming are insane. 

But also it is going to be for the keylogger version of their cable to be clear
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Hahaha I figured, do you recommend the OMG plug + programmer?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Damn, had me excited for a bit. Thought maybe you could load exploits from the flipper to the OMG.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I apologize but this was just a joke ha. I just plugged the plug into the flipper. I'm friends with MG the creator of the OMG products and the other creators and adding their firmware just wouldn't be possible. While the flipper is a cool device to learn on if you really want to take the next step you should consider getting an OMG plug. The badUSB module the flipper offers is OK but pales in comparison to what the omg products offer.

In short, debit cards contain encryption keys that are used to sign transactions and are non-extractable. Cloning them is impossible by design, so the Flipper will never be able to do it.

That gives me an idea to make a shelf to mount to a wall with a usbC on the side, the shelf would be so thin you can't see it, just enough to support the weight of the flipper so the weight isn't on the usbC, then it could look like it's just stuck to the wall... and would be in the correct orientation...

I'd REALLY like to start contributing.
I've been so busy building this OSINT box.....until I realized how many developers use docker.
Tried to get it installed and I borked something up playing around.
I seriously blow out a VM several times a day.....getting old importing then.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
I need one! Pmed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Not hard once you know how to. I just had to watch a bunch of videos and shop around for the cords/beads.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
How hard is it to make these?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-29
Theres integration on the dev branch which you can install the firmware for.

Ordered mine too! But couldn't choose color?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Hey thank you for the files! had a question about the screws, unfortunately I snapped my hinges on the top cover, and the M3 screws I have don't seem to fit through the bottom holes..by chance did I use the wrong screws or is there anything you'd suggest I adjust for my print? :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Fingers crossed. I'll hit ya up once mine arrives, maybe go for a stroll and see what's around once day.

Like my pwnagotchi, this will def be an edc for me. Too handy for an rf nerd lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
You can stream the screen via Bluetooth but you have to be able to see it first....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I haven't had an opportunity to do too much with it yet, but I bet that there are some interesting and outdated vectors around the city. Should be a good flipper playground.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I tossed together notes the other night for setting up/building/flashing firmware from a ubuntu 20 VM if that's the kind of info you're looking for.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yup, might see her crib from this hill even lol. Can't wait for mine to arrive, I work in the city and planning some recon to see what's up. I'm imagining a lot of out dated vectors.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yeah, definitely not far at all! I'm about 10 minutes from Dallastown.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Nvm lol I'm dumb at times
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Wut?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yooo literally around the corner, dallastown here.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
A-effing-men! 

It's amazing, for real. I posted this as a shot in the dark, figuring ain't no way we got more then me and one other on this nerd level.

My oh my, I was certainly proved wrong, there's enough of us to have an annual meetup of Flipper-ness lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I will make a few and msg you when I have them available.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I second this I'm making it to Defcon one of these years
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Will more units in the black color be available in the future?  Or was that a Kickstarter only thing?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Honestly the chances of picking up the animal that are low. You usually need a bigger stronger antenna in my experience with proxmark3s
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
OP mentioned firmware so I guess I'm gonna start looking that direction as they have me stumped too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
You can emulate the screen with the app. But Im not sure you can pair bluetooth without a working screen
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yeah its not in  muddled box. You need to change the branch to mouse juggler get the code and then add it manually. Not sure its worth it in its current state, I cant get it to run indefinitely. Seems tied to how much the button has been pressed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
How???
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I would like to purchase one please.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Website said none in stock.  But I was able to place an order. Will I get my Flipper zero?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Oh fuck! Thats genius! I didnt think of that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I have but it's going to take months to start getting a replacement.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yes absolutely! :3
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
If it arrived broken truly, why not file a claim/support ticket? Im sure they would make it right
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Hey! 

Im sorry to hear your Flipper arrived broken :(

Please send an email to support@flipperdevices.com so we can get this sorted out for you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I wonder if we should just pin a post about locations or in the discord?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
So basically the wifiduck
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
It was a shit show. The material is sandwiched between protective plastic sheets and it kept confusing the auto sense on my blade. I was able to make one for me but went through an entire sheet trying to figure out how to cut through it completely so it's be mailable. Never figured that out unfortunately
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Remind me in 5 days
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I didn't plan to sell any. But if you actually want one, PM me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Installed muddledbox but couldnt find it there. Do I have to manually add this app?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Thanks! Almost drop it a few times, so I had to make something.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Support emailed to say they got me... Haven't heard from em since. About a week now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Sure. I can make you one. PM me and we can talk.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
That's true!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yo, howd it come out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Do you have any for sale? I'm using an old canon lanyard from a 2010s camera
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Just plot the data. Thats about as good as it gets. There isnt raw IQ data like an SDR. Its already demodulated for you. Throw it into a plotting tool and analyze it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Im in the discord as well, who was the user?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Shut up and take my money.JPG
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Have you put the files on your GitHub? Possibly a walkthrough as well, unless its just a simple install.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
It's like the badUSB with wifi control
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
what is that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Nice work!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Counties and towns always seem small until a handful of people pitch into something like a Kickstarter campaign for something incredibly niche and then connect online.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I thinking that's what they thought mine was.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I received mine a week and a half ago or so. I used to live in Red Lion (near Yoe). I am now over near Jacobus. Nice to see other local people on here!

1 : 2022-05-28
I have a Flipper and live in Boston. Currently very ignorant on how to use this device.

Im just happy to have received mine a few Mondays ago!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
It was fine I just bypassed it. I trusted the source. Probably should be more careful, but meh.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Oh s***, local af. I'm in Dallastown LOL that makes me very happy to know there's another flipper in York not going to lie
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Southern York County represent.

Nothing too fun here so far.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Not sure when that was but just yesterday I adjusted the payloads so they are not detected anymore so you should be good. If not let me know and I'll make the proper adjustments. 
They just need to be modified from time to time to stay hidden
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-05-28
Windows defender lost it's shit last time I downloaded some payloads. Lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Keen for more info on this too.  Flippers guide webpage is still blank for GPIO so I assume there is more to come.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Would love to see this too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yeah it looks like write your own firmware at this current point.

If you're cool to come to Dallas, I'm going to be demo'ing the Flipper Zero at the Dallas Hackers Association meeting this Wednesday. It's a very special night (9th Anniversary), so I promise you'll have a blast.

Just order some button keys off Amazon then you can show it read them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Yeah plan to go there this summer. May play. I make it to York a lot also. My parents are down there.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
Like space balls?

You would right now have to write an app. You can follow the hello world example. You would need to know what function calls to use. I am not sure if the documentation exists yet.

Whaat ok I might have to buy this now and learn basic code
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
For older factory firmwares, you'll have to update once with qFlipper to a newer vesion supporting OTAs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I got the same. Very exciting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
I tried 5 teslas today and not a single one worked. So let me get this straight, a Tesla has to be just parked or the owner is close by for it to work?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
and the overhead of building firmware for each test compared to the advertised drag and drop plugin functionality
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-28
[Defcon is super fun.](https://i.imgur.com/W7PIGex.jpg) It's a shame it is cancelled this year.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Oh I see, thanks. I thought it was because Im running Rogue and not Unleashed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
If the Tesla is in sleep mode, it will not open.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Im running RogueMaster and havent gotten a Tesla to open yet, it was a locked parked car. Am I doing something wrong?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Im running RogueMaster and havent gotten it to work on two different Teslas. Has it got to do with the firmware Im running?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Those BadUSB payloads are freaking great! Haha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Stadium security was worried it was a weapon, but I assured them it wasn't. Apparently they thought it was a taser with the contact points, lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Austin area anyone?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
not always the case, for quite a few of my payloads it downloads another script from online and executes it. once it is executed unplugging wont do anything  


but none of the ones i have listed publicly are too dangerous at all   


You could have the script have them subscribe first and then open up a youtube video of your choice
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
You can read the card number off of it but when you go to emulate it acts like a terminal waiting to read a new card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Quick follow up, how do I undo things? Im assuming as soon as I unplug the damage stops propagating?

Also, for the YouTube subscribe script, how could I add a command to watch one of my videos and subscribe?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Im in Arlington

1 : 2022-05-27
Not going to be *officially developed.*   The sources are all there for anyone to contribute what that desire -- I've actually submitted a few changes (that have been accepted into the _dev_ branch) that clean up the reading of EMV cards, mostly so they don't cause crashes or endless loops.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Originally broke my JBL-LSR remote for a pair of studio quality speakers that act as the family rooms speakers.  We always have to get up and turn the volume up and down. Over two years ago I searched for a universal remote solution, which led me to kickstart which led me to the flipper. 2+ years later I finally was able to control my speakers once again thanks to the help of this amazing community and the kind user in Discord who took 15 minutes to manually program and upload the ir file for me from his own universal remote. 

My family and I thank you for this incredible project. I continue to learn more about pen testing, protocols and so much more. Love the rabbit hole this put me down. 

Next up, the BadUSB and the hak5 members git hubs scripts!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Got mine yesterday :)

Wrong sub. This belongs in r/flipperzeror4r
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Yes 15, lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
That's my thought- It would be nice if my pwnagotchi matched the injection molded look of the Flipper so I thought I might as well just give it a try.

I also found that the roughness of the FDM case is a bit abrasive for the display ribbon (although I don't take it in and out that much, so its not \*that\* big of a deal) so it may help with that.

Also I just want to mess around with an SLA printer hahaha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
No news about dumb mode yet, busy implementing other FW features. It'll come eventually, but right now there are more important things to do.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
How about at Defcon?

1 : 2022-05-27
Looks like I just missed it :( either that or no Canada shipping option :/

Curious why the resin one would be better?  I have both types of printers, but never considered printing larger items on the resin.  Smoother lines?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Release. I havent tried the dev builds yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Tried it but it doesn't work.

There is an encrypted part of the card that the flipper cannot decrypt/capture apparently.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
After hearing about people losing limbs for thieves circumventing biometric security, I have doubts.

At least we're not living in a Deus Ex game yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Going into an event in Las Vegas.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Where was this!?!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Thanks! Been eyeballing them for a while. Order Submitted
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Tried cloning CC, Debit Card, Apple Pay from Watch, etc.

None worked.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Learned a lot here. TY for all the comments. I have been looking at this. Great to know about the encryption.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
That's really cool, is there a subreddit for this type of stuff?

I wouldn't even know what terms to use to start looking into it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
7.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
They've posted about this a couple times on the subreddit. They have no intention of writing any more software for bank cards a) because there is encrypted data used for verification with the bank and b) because they don't believe that there's any security testing value on it, as the system is pretty secure. Possible? Yes, but not gonna be developed on for flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
*Release* or *dev* version?    There are updates in *dev* that should address the EMV related issues.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Following for the same reason.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I told security it's a tamagotchi...cuz it is...

And no updates on dumb mode yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I love this community

No go as well, her card like mine has the flowers painted all over it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Lemme try. What's the number?? /s
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Let me try her card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Oh yeah I was able to pick it up on 304.25. Not sure if there is some bug but when I restarted flipper and emulated it again it stopped working. Will make a video of the whole thing. Very weird
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
One is literally a day old, and the other is a month or so old. The older platinums I still have dont have NFC at all.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Interesting...is the one of the new art cards?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Im not sure what is different about yours, but both of my platinum cards are recognized, but the flipper cant decode the EMV.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Like I previous said, it reads all emv nfc cards except my Amex Plat and I was already using the special program.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
If you run the Read bank card special program, it does recognize it as an Amex. If you then run the read EMV app nothing happens.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Babe, stay mad.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Yeah the cases are notoriously finnicky- Im still not fully happy with my pwnagotchis FDM-printed case so might actually ask a friend with a resin printer to try printing a case

Its a pwnagotchi, which is essentially just a WiFi handshake collector with a happy face! 

The good thing about them is that you can make it yourself, you just need a Pi zero, an e-ink display, and, if you feel like it, a UPS battery so it can run without an external battery pack!

If you want to learn a bit more you can head to https://pwnagotchi.ai

Pretty sure that's why Miifare DESfire emulation doesn't work as well. It says it can emulate it but, it's not unleashed yet.

My friend is asking for a link to something we don't talk about
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
If you run the dev version or some of the ones we don't talk about here it works well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Yep and this was with the DoD even then the paperwork was INSANE. 

Makes me wonder 1) what theyve got going on now, 2) what well have in 10 years
-------------------------------

This is not available yet in the current fw or cfws
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Ah yes, my files are all in folders. I guess that's the reason
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Sub-folders don't work, it's in development. So I've been told.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
That's exactly what I'm saying - I see the files there, but not in the app
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
From the main page, hit the down button to access the browser. You should be able to see the folders there.

Most are fine but using the adv-recon or location scripts on some computers might get you in some trouble
-------------------------------

This is so incredibly bad ass and I cant wait to try these out! 

Could anyone here offer some best practices when using these payloads? What is something that can land you in jail?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Yes, it doesn't work. I can only assume that there is additional encrypted data that the Flipper cannot emulate.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Ordered mine! Thanks so much for the alert!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Yea it was absolutely insane back then getting ahold of one of those nsa cables
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Got my order in!
When do you guys think this will ship and get to us ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Insane value in those cables. I remember ordering a similar cable in 2012 and it was literally $35,000
-------------------------------

Use parcel redirect service to buy in US and have it delivered in EU. June batch is for preorder I guess.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
What's the left device?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Nice, thanks a lot!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Not sure!

"EU &amp; UK - Early June, the batch is in production right now" from https://blog.flipperzero.one/quick-start-guide-and-shipping-update/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
When will there be some to ship to europe?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
r/w is easy. NFC is via iPhone app and RFID is through a handheld reader/writer I got on Amazon!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Did it on my iPhone 12. Without a hitch!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Just did the same thing. Figure it will either ship, be a "pre-order", or get cancelled.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
They've restocked, check again!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Check now, they're back in stock (500 units, now down to 380 or so.)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Finally!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Awesome! Glad you got one!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Thank you bro!!!! Snagged one thanks to you!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I just bought! I ignored the copy about it being out of stock. Use a CC if you're concerned.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Thats so awesome. How easy is it to rewrite them if you happen to get another job or something? What else could it be used for? Sorry for all of the questions, I just think this is so cool and really want to get them!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Just ordered one this morning 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Turns out they won't ship to Canada kinda sucks. The Intl page is still out of stock. Kinda tempted to ship it to the boarder tho.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Europeans are still waiting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Trying but the website appears to be getting smashed haha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Disregard the messages on the Header or Info Sections. They are in stock until the 'Add to Cart' is gone.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Still in stock, just scroll down and add to cart. They didn't update the header or info sections.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Check now!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
They just did a restock of 500!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Bro Im not even mad; I just think you should pursue a more honorable side hustle such as shoplifting or content creation

Apparently he didnt even intend to scalp and just worded it really poorly.

And Im not buying one lmao. Im taking inspiration for a similar project more targeted for power quality inspection and industrial I/O.  I just think its a shitty impulse to want to hoard scarce things to profit from their scarcity without actual intent to use

What does it mean region locked? What happens if you use a US flipperzero in the UK?
-------------------------------

Got mine too!!
-------------------------------

Got mine this afternoon!
-------------------------------

Says out of stock for Canada 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I got one as soon as I got the discord notification!  That being said the discord chat was mad yesterday.   A lot of people were very dissatisfied that US was getting more orders when other countries didnt have backer orders yet.   No one read the post and understood why.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Hmm alright. Thanks for the quick reply
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
This is the best/most clever way. Use Raw Record and press the sequence of buttons you want to engage.  Remember to include delays!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I saw this in the app.  Of course, I haven't been able to try it yet, since the firmware that shipped was too old to support it.  :)  Maybe next time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Hopefully they restock soon
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Doesnt look like it unfortunately
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I have the same remote for my fan. Was able to get it in read and read raw. Just had to basically touch it to the flipper to read it tho. Hope that helps.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Or not use an iPhone
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Already sold out?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Thanks that was all I needed to know. No pitchfork here honey :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Do they only make stock available via Discord notifications? I am from the UK waiting for a announcement from their mailing list to buy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
i got a shipping email with my address and tracking number! I'm getting mine next week!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Unpair the flipper in your phone's BT settings app and pair it again
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I will get my flipper the moment everyone in the us and their grandmas have one
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Maybe! Still learning. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Wait really?

Come on guys have you ever heard of jailbreaking?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
I noticed, very keen. Lots of happy people on Kickstarter too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
[removed]
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
FYI looks out of stock again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
Ive got NFC in my right and RFID in my left hand, its was the first thing I scanned too. Got my implants at DEFCON a couple years ago and backed the flipper specifically to mess with them. Its been a long wait.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
You really calling him a scalper for selling one unit for more than he paid?
Thin skinned little bitch is what you are, stop caring so much about what others do with their stuff, just because you haven't gotten yours yet doesn't mean you need to be salty.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-27
some time away, i was one of the backers from a while back and only just got the notice that it was being shipped. i should get it next week. yay.

but yeah, no i payed for it like 2019....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Could you DM me as well? Thanks in advance
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Sendle just emailed me an hour ago saying they'd just received my package, so can confirm.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Damn, I would definitely not thought about the CR2032 but thats a great call to widen your range of remotes to work with!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
The units for backers are already produced and shipped. It's out of their control how long it's taking for shipping to complete to every location on the planet (China only just stopped blocking the entire shipment to Australia, I finally got my last-mile tracking number today.) 

Taking orders for new units doesn't magically redirect devices that are still in transit.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Anymore still in stock???
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Tested and works great on an LG G8x

TIL there are people out there voluntarily chipping themselves.

The WiFi module is for debugging so far. 

Could you not use Bluetooth?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I hope that means delivered in a month, not a month after its shipped!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Yep they updated the shipping page with this information days ago.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
It just took my order a moment ago. Are these heavily backordered or will they actually put one in the mail for me soon?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
In the old GWBasic REM was short for remark, a comment
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Ordered mine today!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
my order says a MONTH shipping 6.6
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Jk, I'm a dummy and didn't scroll. Website still says out of stock at the header but below you can order.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I still see pre-order on mobile, currently located in MN, USA. Gonna try a few different alternatives just in case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
It's all about supply and demand in the first place. Availability drives cost. Everything is a risk. Suck it up man.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Will they though because it implies the company supports broadcasting on that frequency
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Yeah, you would have to reset it back to the default firmware to get back on the primary branch. Or just wait until this one is updated.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
iirc it said 23+ days when I checked out.  have hope!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
if i take this firmware does that invalidate the firmware updates in the future?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
When do we think it'll arrive?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
To my knowledge from reading the Discord off and on today, the best I can tell if it allowed you to place the order you are one of the 3000 stockpiled units.  The website still said out of stock while this was happening.  Though today you could actually add one to cart and go to check out.  

A lot of people in the discord were very upset that flipper would sell these units to customers that already have kickstarter backer sales because people in other countries who have not got theirs yet.  The reason they were available to sale has to do with Im assuming FCC laws and shipping. The laws in the United States are a little bit more laid-back and so we have more frequencies available to us in the firmware, than that of what other countries would have. Therefore those 3000 units had to be sold here in the United States.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
would there be a way to check if my order is one of those?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
You literally just called it profit not selling a possession to cover my needs and said you bought another one for gains, which I understood as again scalping intentionally

Like shit sorry your family member died, but if I said yeah so I took this suckers catalytic converter for a slick profit  and someone came back like dude thats fucked up dont do that and I reply with wow I cant believe you didnt understand I needed that money to access psychiatric care for my trauma resulting from childhood sexual assault. Thanks guys

See how even though its fucked up that happened to me, Im still not exactly coming off sympathetic? Hope that helps you understand the feedback you got here
-------------------------------

Felt like months.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
They are in stock for US customers.   Placed my order today too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
There was a update today for US customers.   They are shipping current stock of 3000 extra flippers that are currently in stock.  The discord was a nasty mess earlier around 4pm eastern time.  Guess they cant be sold to other countries that still dont have backer/pre orders due to legal issues with how they are region coded based off our own laws about radio frequency in use.

TL:DR Flipper released 3000 units today that are already in stock.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Yeah me too. I mind though. Shouldn't be an issue as long as I can cancel LOL. Don't feel like waiting a year.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I thought the ones ordered today were already in inventory. I don't mind waiting again. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Shipping updates here: https://ship.flipp.dev/

But I think if you ordered today thats just a pre order for the future production. People receiving flippers at the moment ordered over a year ago
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Can find shipping updates here

https://ship.flipp.dev/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Just ordered mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
they are only selling them for US residents only. they were overproduced US UNITS. Flippers are region locked because of FCC type laws. they couldnt give these to UK or other residents even if they wanted to. set down your pitchfork
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I didnt find any good way to do it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
did you figure it out? i wonder if there's a way to do it without forking firmware every time there is an update. Any way to change the region?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Still cant order them to the uk 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I had to find funds for a family emergency, nothing wrong with that. I am not a scalper but the flight for the funeral costed double that. Thanks guys.

im on the latest firmware but still getting the same error. anything specific i should do to remove restrictions on my end?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Badass
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Was a doctor friend of mine but a local piercer might do it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
So youre a scalper? Ever considered a hustle outside parasitism?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Negative. The 3000 units are leftovers from USA
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Where did you get it done?( local doctor or somebody the company has on payroll)??
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
There are multiple regions they are producing and had extra NA made. So these wont affect any of the other regions that are still needing to be produced/shipped
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Was that in email?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
yup! here: [https://dangerousthings.com/category/implants/x-series/](https://dangerousthings.com/category/implants/x-series/)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
So cool! The NFC implant has a light that turns on?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
How are they selling them if the Kickstarter backers haven't received theirs?!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
oh dang. :( Soon though! fingers crossed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Yeahhhhhhhh that's what I was figuring. Hey that's what GPIO is for.

Simply copy/paste the order you want into a text file - the universal tv script txt file isn't just a toy it's a sample of how you format long strings of commands.

-------------------------------

Can't you record that sequence of commands?

Looks like it got Smashed!

But seriously, my condolences. Maybe reach out to the Flipper team on discord and see what's possible to fix it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I'm guessing there's not a warranty repair on this hahaha.   Think maybe one of the soldering pads probably came loose.  Will have to break it apart to see.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
Mine came with a small discoloration on the screen. Looks like someone is pressing on it with their thumb.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
I'm guessing support is overwhelmed at the moment. It seems ALOT of units were shipped with crimped battery cables, causing issues with charging and/or powering on at all. Support was not responding at all to my requests, so I had to open my flipper up and move some cables around. It turned on, but still is not charging at all.

I totally understand that they're overwhelmed, but there's been no real acknowledgement of this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Also wound up stripping 3 of the screws while opening it up. I have a high quality precision screwdriver set with extra long bits. I'm pretty surprised by the ease of which the screws stripped, putting almost no pressure on them. I had to use a small drillbit and small screw extractor set to remove the remaining pieces. Now I need to purchase new screws that fit. I'll probably see if I can change them out for hex or torx screws instead of standard cheap easy to strip phillips.

Yep! I think they also do some fancy things for fade/blink/random effects but yeah I'm going that's basically it.

Regarding the battery, they are replaceable button cells (though yeah, I doubt they last very long).

Neat concept! Now what are you flashing the Pi Zero with? :P
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-26
That should be easy to decipher - I imagine a a valid string with open duration color value close or something close to that.  In addition to capturing IR signals you may want to document duration and color for each signal as you capture it.  


It seems the wrist bands have an intentionally-limited battery, it wouldn't surprise me if they include a type of suicide battery to disable the embedded system once it's out of their control.  A obsolescence safeguard to encourage people to return them.

PixMob makes two types of LED wristbands--the BLE type (which are what those FCC filings are for) and the IR type. The BLE ones are usually used for smaller events, and the IR ones are usually used for larger ones.

Here's an FCC filing for a transmitter for the IR type:

It's in the 900 MHz spectrum and should be able to be picked up but it seems to use two-way communication, base stations are synced over ethernet with bluetooth remote control but the base units both send and receive signals - which could inhibit your ability to do anything productive.

problem is you don't know the manifest/shipping info to request the status.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
I emailed to find out what it was and they're claiming it's some kind of COVID related thing. I've gotta say I'm really not sure about it, and because we don't have a batch/shipping number for the customs lot we can't query customs directly.  


Yes, I'm impatient and I admit it.

i am indeed a fan of the plug and carry it with me everywhere. its perfect for demonstrations. it just doesnt have the keylogging or self destruct feature but besides that i love it sooo much
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
Well if you see them available again please let me know. Im going to keep checking. If you buy a second one and want to sell it Ill buy it from you even if I get one as well because I want a second to gift to my dad.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
I'm thinking the plug and not the cables, for versatility.

Omg has a few extra but worth it features

Small world indeed
If you end up needing help for anything let me know

Is there, or what is, the difference in a Rubby Ducky payload compared to a O.MG payload. Are they compatible or nah?

Oh are they randomly restocking? I have just been checking assuming there would be a big drop. Thanks for the heads up!

@jakobyscream I recently found your scripts on Hak5, now I see you here. Small world!
I know it's not flipper related but I also received a wifi rubbernugget. Are you by chance planning on formatting your scripts for use on the rubbernugget?

Oh man. Im completely new at this kind of stuff. I keep getting an Error line 1 message on my flipper every time I try it. I copied it and made it a txt, put my dropbox, and put it in the badusb folder then ran on flipper and plugged it in. Would anyone be willing to give me any tips? Github is a bit confusing for me still.

Essentially yes 

It's just so you can leave comments for people reading your code

I get wide range from garage doors, TV remotes, RC remotes, and even found a keycard one time (but mostly TV remotes). The best ones are the GoodWills that have a tech section. 

Only had one encounter with an employee, but after showing them what I was doing and giving them a "demonstration" they thought it was super cool and wanted to watch lol. 

I play to upload them to the IR Dump that's added on Awesome Flipper in GitHub, but I fist have to figure out how to do that haha.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
These can be used for any hak5 device as well. The flipper is just a little more temperamental and needed some adjustments. 

Lol and thank you 
I can definitely help if needed 
Just got to work now so replies may be slow etc but my contact details are there if you want to get ahold of me on discord or something
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-25
You are an evil genius!
I was trying to figure out how to make the sample script on Hak5 work for regular USB for a marketing "thing" I plan on doing.
I saw a method to have the user information sent via SMS and take the user to the NIST page warning them about plugging in flash drives.
Would love some help on that.
So these are ONLY for the Flip or can be used on any USB with the Hak5 modifications?
Apologies as I am just starting to learn python now. This particular script has had my eye for months.
What if they do not have a MS login on the account and it is just local account?
I need to test this ASAP. Amazing job!

A good bet would be to check your pets vet book and that will have info about the chip. Hopefully this includes the brand then its a case if looking for documentation or maybe look up the spec of a pet microchip reader and work out what that does that flipper doesnt.

This is a genius idea. What kind of remotes did you get?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-24
Make sure you actually have the files. I ran into this a few days ago. If you try to download a single file off github all you get is a link, you have to go to the main page there will be a green "code" button in there is download as zip. When you have it all then you can navigate to what you actually want in file explorer and put that on your SD card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-24
To learn? Just a guess.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-24
Maybe try opening the remote and wiring some batteries to the contacts closer to the circuit board to bypass the corroded parts

There are functionally 2 manufacturers on the market (with numerous brands) and everything in the last 25 years has had a rolling code.  


Functionally anything that can be attacked by [OpenSesame](https://github.com/samyk/opensesame) can be programmed in, but that list is pretty small these days.

Oh I see looked at most recent DFU release notes it shows removing a few things one of them the spectrum analyser for memory performance or something.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
That sounds about right but I don't have the wav player or clock, though I've been wanting. 

I think I'm just on an older version probably? I haven't had time the past day or so to really mess with mine much.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
Aww I was hoping for Spirit: emotional battery and public humiliation.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
So I did it via that method and I do not see the spectrum analyzer or much of anything. It added a clock, tetris, a wav player and that's about it. I'm not convinced it fully installed it.

Inspectrum - awesome program to decode iq files from hackrf

Gqrx

Cubicsdr - awesome for captures based on triggers, records when remote is pressed

Audacity - good for decoding, cutting and passing code

Gnu radio - excellent for decoding

There are a few more but that's all I got off the top of my head that I use. 

Python scripting will come in handy as I'm sure you are aware with linux. Love linux.

This is a very old firmware repo.  I quit messing around with it for a while.  Best bet is to copy the music_player.c file to their firmware.

When you go to turn it off from settings it askes to take the USB out for safe power off and it dies before the power off so I'm not sure what to do
-------------------------------

I run both Linux and Windows. I'm currently got a dual boot environment set-up. 

If you wouldn't mind dropping a list of software that would be amazing. :) Thanks for the response!

1 : 2022-05-23
Ah gotcha. Without an sdr there isn't much you will be able to do besides replay attacks. Copying fixed code remotes. If you still want assistance once you get your sdr I am more than willing to help you. Are you using Linux or windows? Linux has so much to offer in the way of sdr software. I can give you a list of software to have installed for when your sdr arrives. Let me know

Do you have any additional information on how you achieved these things?   
Or is this post just a "I did it." type of post?   


Just curious if you're willing to outline what you've done, rather then just stating you did it.

Even if you did, isn't the radio lower bound around 300MHz?

That's strange. I put in my order 2 weeks ago. Still nothing. I even sent an email to their support email.

1 : 2022-05-23
Not currently and implementing such a feature is probably not trivial. You would need to implement a codec, a profile for the audio, and support for some audio format

I just ordered the wifi board and extra breadboards, I got a order confirmation email from them.

Hmm, my KS pledge came with one pack of boards not sure about the availability now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
Good question, though of course it wouldnt have a way of processing the audio.  This just provides the radio with power.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
Did you buy them from the shop or got them from the KS? People has been complaining that Flipper team has not send any confirmations when people buy stuffs from the shop.

Gotcha. Would be great if we as a community were able to get a unified repo going with all our findings/codes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-23
Yea those are from Sammy kamkars opensesame project. Those do not work. They are specific to model and most receivers need to hear the code more than once. On some really older garages it may work but not likely any you will encounter. I looked into the coding and none of the dip switch garages I encountered were a part of his code.

I have a lot of packages installed so it would be hard to tell. What error are you getting?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
Can you do a brew list (or what ever the command is) to see what packages you got for the ones needed for the build. There is an open git issue for the mac build. (Not mine) but I have the same issue.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
I had no issue building on mac (installed dependencies via brew)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
Tried both on my MacBook Pro as of last night. The Linux instructions may work. But docker and Mac OS X via brew are dead in the water currently.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
Since when? I compile in Linux using the official instructions and it works fine. Strange that the others would have issues.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
I worked through the Hello World example, it worked well enough. I think I had to tweak a line or two to get it to run. I think the actual plugin aspect of plugins is still coming. As far as capability, I believe a plugin can do anything the firmware can do; its all open source.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
Getting the stock firmware to compile is basically impossible both the docker image and the native mac build via brew installing the tool chain dont work since they both end up with too new of a version of the compiler. Hopefully they solve that soon.

Looks like the repo hasn't been updated in a while. Any plans to update the firmware version to be closer inline with 58.1 or have you made your changes into a plugin that works with the official firmware?

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."

"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

How did you connect the three devices? I assume via the GPIO?

Yes, his attack works very simular. Unfortunately it does not work for my garage door as the receiver must hear the code the times in a row to activate. Also mine has additional padding code after the 9 dip switch code. But you are correct his work with debruijn was very impressive. Unfortunately it does not work on very many garages or gates.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-22
Well done! 

Your attack sounded familiar and I remembered this talk from Samy Kamkar: https://youtu.be/1RipwqJG50c

Which describes how he brute forces all 812 bit codes for fixed code garages in &lt;9s.

Surely you meant to type 134.2**K**hz?

I use python to create debruijn sequences for brute forcing, flipper uses c language. You can find many python codes for debruijn already on github
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Chuck it up on GitHub bro!! 

Also, what's the significance of this, as in what was the issue with this type of garage door that it wasn't able to be done with Flipper alone? Is it a rolling code like security+2 or something?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
that's still good stuff. Learning takes time. I have plenty of rf experience with sdr's, my favorite is hackrf one. I would recommend getting a cheap one from Amazon, once you really decode a signal, baud rate, binary code and transmit the code back without using the original capture then you start to understand how rf transmission and receivers actually work. It's a lot of fun. Keep plugging away.

Such a vague question
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Yes sir. If you have a sdr and a garage remote that has dip switches, change the code(take a pic so you can change it back) make sure it has one of each dip setting, some are trinary(3 dip positions, up, middle, down) capture a raw signal and send me the capture, model, and any other info and we can get started!!

Nicely done! I get bored before it gets that long! &gt;\_&gt;  
I'm tempted to tweak it so that you don't lose when you run into the edge of the screen, but instead wrap around to the other side - seems a little more interesting as then the only way to lose is to run into yourself, which seems slightly more interesting to me.

Figured it out. favorites.txt in the root menu was corrupted some how. Deleted it via FZ file explorer and then pinned successfully.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Flashed stock release firmware no change, favorites are gone and when you click "Pin",  unpin never shows up. No matter how many times you press pin, it does nothing.

How do you get the Frequency Analyzer to work?  I can get to the screen but the numbers just stay at 0
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
There are firmware versions that unlock all frequencies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Yep.

Yup, it reaches a game over condition when the snake gets too long, since you run into your own tail.

Not OC, but it must depend on the mobile app, I use Relay and it doesn't show the "About" tab.

Huh, I only see the text "Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in Tamagotchi body. It loves to hack digital stuff around such as radio protocols, access control systems, hardware and more. It's fully opensource and customizable so you can extend it in whatever way you like." In the side bar and no sections or wikis or anything like that. But I am also on mobile and I think my app uses old apis. I'll check it out on desktop. Thanks.

I went to McDonald's and after I got my food I shut off the screen with the orders on it. I went back on a different day to see they didn't even fix it from when I shut it off last time so turned it back on for them lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Nope, that's why I'm posting it, because it seems so strange. I thought maybe it was neglect, but the status says happy. I noticed it happens while just chilling in my pocket, but this time I had just rebooted it so everything was "fresh"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Did you have anything plugged into the GPIO port?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Dang, that's super strange. Good luck!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Well beyond that now, its been flashed and running  custom they literally just disappeared. Maybe I'll reset it and reflash again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
I would use the firmware tool and reflash latest or update to it if you're on the one out of the box.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
OK, heres a question:  if you add multiple dots to a note, does each dot add half again of the ORIGINAL NOTE only, or half again of the note plus all previous dots (like compound interest)?  Im trying to replicate sheet music that has a dotted half note tied to an eighth note: that should be 7/8ths of a measure.  If I do 1F#, thats 8/8ths, too long.  If I do 2F#., thats 6/8ths, too short.  I thought 4F#.. would do it: a quarter note (2/8ths) plus five eights should equal 7/8ths, but it ends up playing MUCH longer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Good to know, In this case I had just rebooted it though and Bluetooth is off.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
It also shows up when your device is locked while connected to qFlipper/mobile app
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Now it just auto-locked and no exclamation point...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
It goes away, but I noticed it always isn't there while locked.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
It means that your Flipper needs to be unlocked to continue something or that it auto-locked with an app open. Try unlocking it and see what happens.
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Sigh all you want, but to me the Flipper seemed like a fun way to get into the world of pen-testing and cyber shenanigans without too much prior experience thats the reason why I backed it on kickstarter two years ago! Rather than be condescending towards noobs like us, why dont you try being helpful?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Not exactly? It's katakana, which they use for foreign words. It's just a transliteration of the English word. I have no idea what the noun is in proper Japanese but I'm sure they have a word for it. 

Google translate says "" (ashi hire).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Ok, cool

Depending on your firmware, you could manually retune the RFID reader. Try Engin33r's build in debug mode.

Hot damn, thank you for the deep dive explanation. I appreciate that you took the time to write all that. 
There is so much competition to be #1 here in the states that it is rare for companies to work together in earnest to establish and implement a solution for the greater good. All big business seems to care about is me me me right noble now now. I understand everyone is in business to make money, but what I dont understand is the drive to make more and then make even more. As a culture here, enough is never enough. It doesnt matter, were all gonna die someday anyway, why not make it enjoyable for everyone while were here?

First you need to install the latest Unleashed or RougeMaster DFU file using a custom firmware in qFlipper.

DFUs:
- https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/releases/latest
- https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/releases/latest

Then check out Awesome Flipper to get additional files to load on your flipper using qFlipper.

I somehow missed the fact that it could be *controlled* from the phone app. I love this thing even more now lol thank you kind stranger
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-21
Wondering this as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
You would need to run non official firmware, super easy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Not to sound like a dick but there are plenty of resources available, official documentation, Discord, and here.  You definitely should familiarize yourself with the device and its capabilities before diving into anything on GitHub.

Start by just running the latest official firmware and playing around with it.  Join the Discord and read through the pinned messages and channel history, there is tons of info that will help you get started.

I've got a few wireless doorbells in a commercial environment...

I've been going around for the last week pulling a C battery out of the receiver just to stealthily steal the signal.

Hue hue heh.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Why did you buy it if you don't know what it does?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Thats what I did
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
lol that is possibly more vague than before! This is just like getting a new screwdriver. Its a tool, so you need to know what kind of things you were planning to use it for and then we can help point you to how to do them. For example, I wanted to prank my brother with his wireless doorbell, so I recorded the sub gig signal and played it back from inside the house. (Unfortunately his wife caught me recording it, so she knew something was up and ruined it, but you get the idea.)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
First step is get a sdcard installed on the flipper. Got to flipper zero website and download the software and update your flipper. This will unlock the database and make some of the settings unlock. Second thing is download the flipper app. This allows remote screen and ways to monitor your flipper without bring it out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
I think hes talking about when youre looking at files instead of having the folder icon its a question mark
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Ok i just got my flipper zero.  What can and should i be doing with it. I want to have fun and enjoy it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Respectfully, your question is so vague it makes it kind of hard to offer help. Can you be more specific? A link to the files youre trying to install might help us understand the problem youre running into.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
It will work fine without any GitHub files. Its just a super deluxe universal remote. Just Discover, copy, save, use.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
What are you doing with the files, install what? and what are the files?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Da
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
install them without the question mark!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Well lets start with, what are you trying to do with what files on GitHub
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
thats why im here! please elaborate on what im unaware of! im here for genuine ELI5 knowledge.  I understand it as is, i dont understand the adding of files and executing them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
You need to understand you device and its basic capabilities before you jump into GitHub
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Im in USA, yes. Modern card? What fancy fancy do we not even know about yet.?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Is it any less legit to hack a hacking tool to get what you want, rather than just using the tool to hack stuff? Might even be more legit.

Let me guess: USA? The banking system there tends to lag behind the rest of the world, hence my comment about modern cards.

In case you are curious: a flipper is a broad flat limb without fingers, used for swimming by various sea animals.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Many iPhone and Android apps can do this. You, in theory, could write to the flipper from that app.

-------------------------------

While in SubGhz??
Oh, nope only when out of any app can you do this... we can't see them from the 'saved' location in the app.
Thank you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Yeah I'd have to remove the connector on the battery from the wires to check how good the connection on them are then check the solder points on the board itself still. I got annoyed and walked away from it lol since I know that's going to take some time to make sure it's good.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
I've run the only update file I can find and still get the message. I've copied the entire zip file to the SD card as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
I had that happen for a minute. The wire could be internally damaged. I'd try unplugged the connector and reconnecting it too just in case. Maybe you'll find some position of the wire that works.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
ohhhhhhhhh neat :D

Which region are you?

Is it possible to change region of our Flipper?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Press down from the home screen and then left, itll take you to the filebrowser :)

Flippers current filesystem works like this:

-Individual files will appear normally

-Folders (with or without subfolders) will only appear in the file browser (down, left from the homescreen)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
I just read the marquee. 

Goes to show how customizable the flipper is. :)

I recorded our garage door clicker and when I went down to replay "This frequency is not authorized for Rx in your region"

Makes the thing pretty much useless if you cant easily perform replay attack (that I could do with an Ubertooth, YardStick, or SDR and a PiZero).

I just got mine, so haven't looked into modified firmware or modifying the code (which I'm sure is 100% possible).

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Finally took mine apart a lot more and it looks like either the connector on the battery is bad or the port on the device itself is bad because wiggling it at the terminal makes it come on or off and moving wires doesn't affect it at all. Emailed them a few day ago anyways so hopefully I'll hear something regarding a replacement (laughs in crying)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
I made a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Tonsil/flipper-music-files) for the files. It's probably easier than copying from here. I added another one for the theme from "Airwolf".

Noob here too. Can you explain on some of the way to compile? Do I need Docker or something?

Your comment helped me figure out how to download the repo from github and then I decided to upload the tesla stuff and the garage door stuff... but it said it was too large for qFlipper, so I uploaded it directly to the SD card, but now when I go to "saved" under the subghz app, it says "Empty Folder." Tried rebooting it to see if it'd refresh, but it just can't seem to see the files.

Not a noob question at all! Github can be very confusing. When its large directories of files, theyll usually give you an option to download the whole thing as a zip. But when you want just smaller pieces of a directory (like the two tesla files), i use downgit.github.io

Theres probably other ways to do it, but [heres](https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroSub-GHz/tree/main/Vehicles/Tesla) the download like to the tesla files using downgit.

Many do, and you should be glad if you cant. If you can, Id seriously look into upgrading your opener to one with rolling codes.
-------------------------------

I too would like to check this out. Dm please. Well mainly I'm dl all firmwares in anticipation for when I receive mine XD
-------------------------------

I have opened all models. The S has a really tiny port door, is it possible you just didnt notice it opened?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Looked straight blue to me. But now I cant tell..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
The problem is that the signal has to One - be public so it works with any Tesla Charger for remote operation of the cover. Two - can already be opened by pressing on the door handle to wake the car and then pressing on the charging port. There is nothing to gain by doing this anyway. But I think it's pretty awesome because I always knew it was possible to replay the signal, but now I can do it. :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-20
Ohhhhhhhhh... Thanks

And it's not just Teslas, it affects any keyless entry. I think they took some means of mitigation. As my phone has to be upright or unlocked to open my car. (I think) It's sometimes a pain in the ass.

I like writing software for it so I flash it every few minutes :/

I'm a fanboy and I upvoted. It's important for people to understand relay attacks, and take measures to protect themselves. Or steal a Tesla if your into that sort of thing. /s

I was able to open my Model 3 charge port. You can also open the charge port without it by pressing on the door handle to wake the vehicle and then pressing down on the charge port cover.

Kickstarter backer here. Super excited! Within 10 minutes of unboxing we:

1. Copied my office RFID
2. Read and saved my watch NFC CC
3. Turned the TV on and off

My 11 daughter, rightly impressed, started trying to read the dogs chip. which I understand is supported in HW so Im sure software is just around the corner.

Bravo Flipper team. Excellent work relaxing your vision. Youve delivered such a cool thing!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
That was me!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I tried a gate remote and my Flipper said Security+ 2.0 when I tried to save it. That is one of the rolling code formats not currently supported in the default firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Interesting. I thought the signal was emitted from the charge cable connector. If so, would these older  models not automatically open when you push the button on the cable?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
No it doesnt
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Oh, sorry I mean does the flipper itself know it was successful, like does it provide any feedback that it opened or closed the charge door?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Yeah you can see the port open by the rear drivers side taillight, I just did another one a few minutes ago. Next time Ill record and post it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Does it know if it was successful?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I hope not.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Agreed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Copy the comments and paste into a file, e.g. "Hedwigs\_Theme.fmf". The .fmf extension is important. Attach your Flipper to your computer and open qFlipper. Click on the File manager tab, then SD Card, then music player. In there should be the file for Marble\_Machine.fmf. Copy your new file into that folder, and the player should immediately be able to find it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Maybe we need to capture the signal from an older one?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Theres code on GitHub that allows you to open the charging panel on Teslas
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
What do you mean you hit every tesla you see? Im obviously missing some difference in teslas and other cars?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Same. May I also have this link?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I figured I wouldn't be the first person to do that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Awesome!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I can confirm, the outside screws are PH0 and the inside ones are PH00 and PH0 mixed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
That sounds like something is indeed wrong with the vibration motor. Please contact support@flipperdevices.com, tell them about your situation and attach your dolphin's name and serial number
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Not yet, but the hardware is able to run at 132mhz, so enabling firmware support for this is possible, and will probably be added in the future.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Completely unofficial, but trying to get a useful wiki together for community documentation in one place (including stuff that's official but spread throughout the forums, official but was mentioned/discussed on Discord, unofficial firmware, etc).

Yep, that's my plan exactly, lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Its a RFID chip so theoretically yes you can; However, it still has to be working, able to be powered by Flipper (or another power source), and the right frequency. 

From reading a bit animal id frequency is set at 132.2kHz and the scanner on Flipper is 125kHz.

Just looks like a black one with the orange condom.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Haha I dropped mine about 1 onto rather padded carpet and it wouldn't turn back on. 

Had to go buy a screwdriver for it and took two screws out and it came back on. Odd I thought but back together and so far it's been okay.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
It depends on the protocol used but Skorp in the discord and telegram knows a lot about it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Is this spray painted or dyed? Looks really good 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
If you're careful, you could just drill the screw head off. After you get the cover removed there might be enough of it protruding to get out with pliers. Either way, 3 screws is plenty to hold it together I suspect
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Thank you! Ill keep my eyes open for folks projects around NFC as more people get their device and start tinkering! I appreciate the response! Maybe someone here has done it successfully and can walk us through it!

1 : 2022-05-19
It is definitely possible to push a vCard through NFC. But I dont have the C coding skills to tel you how to do it via Flipper. I think the projects will really start taking off once we get the arduino support that was promised.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Running the alert from the app should do something so if it doesnt sounds like a hardware issue. Apparently the solution to most hardware issues right now is loosening the screws a little bit. But may void warranty or something too idk.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
ppl dont know how to take any jokes on here
-------------------------------

Yeah...stripped one of mine and I have the same issue. Now I'm stuck. My screw extraction kit bits are too short.

I'm very interested in the rolling codes emulation, but mostly for my garage door opener. Do you know where I can read up more on this?

A LOT!!! Everything, multiple times a day.

A lot, I use it everyday, multiple times a day. I hit every Tesla I see, multiple NFC reads and saves, infrared, subG. I pretty much try to hack everything I can.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Same. Keeps dumpin g back to 0
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Ohh, interesting. I did not realize those were in there. If anyone knows what rolling code protocol is used for a MyQ system, I can go try to program and report back.
-------------------------------

Ooohh I do indeed. Thanks mate!

I believe it does already have several rolling-code protocols. For example, if you use the "DoorHan315" option when selecting "Add Manually", every time you press the Send button, the code showed on the screen changes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I believe someone would need to implement some sort of rolling code emulator app to make this work where the garage reciever would learn the rolling code preset by the flipper. I was curious about using the flipper as a programmed garage door remote as well, but I do not believe I have seen anyone implement rolling code yet.

Thanks. After waiting so long to get it, I was really disappointed to receive one that didn't work. Dug through some forums and someone mentioned that theirs mysteriously worked after removing the back cover. Removing the back cover was easy enough but didn't fix mine. Was lucky to find that disassembly video because I couldn't tell which screws needed to be removed next. Then when I saw the wires I knew I had found the culprit heh.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
Great question.  The build quality is exquisite.  The entire thing is completely aluminum with very intricate design details.  The tolerances are extremely tight and there is not dead space (attributing to poor acoustics).  inserts are made of high quality rubber and the PCB is slotted for optimum flex.  It also features you choice of custom aluminum insert.  If that wasn't enough, the exclusivity is also valuable as they no longer have them in stock.   Also keep in mind that the original group buy price was like $550, a year ago ( granted after all of the keycaps, switches and accessories, I'm probably at eh $1k mark with this build).  


Generally speaking in the Mechanical Keyboard community, keyboard are commissioned in a group buy model where there is no guarantee that they will ever be made again, making them highly desirable collector pieces (think of group buys like KickStarters  that will only run once per product).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
You're absolutely right. Keyless entry raises insurance fees over here. 

My three-letter-german vehicle is not fitted with keyless entry and as a paid security professional, I am more than happy with this.

It is not hard, to extend the range of a keyless fob and open a car. If memory serves me well, someone even used rc cars to drive between houses (keyless fob) and cars, to open them...

[Here](https://youtu.be/38pHe7M4vl8) is a video showing disassembly. You'll need a precision phillips screwdriver (short bits won't reach). Mine came on as soon as the cover was removed. I moved the wires down a little to where they should have been and reassembled it pretty easily.

I tried the reboot more than a few times, no change. Good call on #2 because I figured that out with the second card that actually worked (the light blinked green and the read happened shortly after) - nothing happens with the other one though. 

It's an iClass HID. I'm now learning that iClass is not yet supported (but possibly being worked on) so that makes sense. It just seemed weird that it worked at first and then didn't the next day.

Thanks!

It's possible there is some sort of signature on it to determine if the ID is cloned or the original. You see it a lot in consumer products like printers that want you to use only their proprietary supplies. But it's difficult to know with the limited info

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
If someone can get me the exact specs then I'd be happy to make some extras. Ideally a vector file, but I'd be happy with the screen size + corner radius. It's the corner radius I'm mostly not sure of.

You either set your son up for get success (in which I hope he achieves) or a criminal record (less likely). I'm rooting for success, and I would suggest going into pen testing jobs. 

Also, don't let him try to clone newer car fobs as he will desync them. It only works on older cars, trust me...

The code for the remote can be found [here](https://github.com/jimilinuxguy/flipperzero-universal-rf-remote)

Submit big issues, feature requests, or PR there as well. Roguemaster or any other repository that includes it does not support the code and cant offer much help

I removed the TouchTunes app and made it a universal remote app as to not promote illegal/activity and also provide a more generic and reusable app. 

You can find the code for the remote here: [FlipperZero Universal Remote](https://github.com/jimilinuxguy/flipperzero-universal-rf-remote)

how do you reset the flipper? mine was so good i forgot it in 15 minutes lol

Now that's cool!
Reminds me of when we used stone paint on things.
Got some downstairs. 
Would be cool to even marble it.
Also removable

I have the same issue running:

On my Linux machine running Xubuntu 20.04. It has worked fine up until a day or two ago, now nothing. This is the error it spits out:

Did you manage to do it?

FZ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I mean there is more than just subghz. You can learn some basic badusb script that doesn't harm your PC, like just writing some basic hello worlds. There is a demo file in FZ that will teach you.

It can scan credit cards that have NFC chips. Just scan your own cards then delete them if you don't know what to do with them.

It also gain exp everyday, so even if you don't do anything it will lvl up. Just make sure you play with it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-19
I have done a few remotes but don't have any 1ghz stuff around the house. Any good places/things in public u have scanned/hacked?

I am aware that there seems to be an issue with the 125KHz feature, I just want to make it clear for anyone who might get confused testing their flipper or other device with that DT diagnostic card and dont have anything else to test with. It wont actually scan anything - it will only make the corresponding LED on the card flash slowly.

It is for field detection/antenna testing only, so you can detect and determine the frequency of an unknown reader without registering an actual scan which could raise red flags.

This is a solid method, but just a reminder to anyone new to this stuff that this method against anything using a rolling code will kill the legitimate fob/remote until its re-synced.

Dont screw with it unless you know that its not a rolling code, or have the ability to re-sync, or dont care and/or have a backup fob/remote.

Easiest way is just to get the .dfu from github. Then open qFlipper and click "update from file", click the .dfu file and it'll flash it on.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Phooey on add manual! ;)

Try Sub-GHz &gt; Frequency Analyzer, then hold your current remote near flipper and press the normal "open" button and see if it finds the frequency. 

Then take that info to Sub GHz &gt; Read &gt; Config and try the different modulations and see if this picks it up. If it does try emulating what you just saved. 

If this doesn't, try "read raw" with a similar process.

What's up with everyone having to compile Unleashed? I didn't compile anything.

My version is from [14-05-2022 and is labeled 7ca5cd48.](https://i.imgur.com/MX54UGj.jpg) I'm pretty sure Unleashed is what I installed via a .dfu found on their git. 

I have the [great spectrum analyzer](https://i.imgur.com/XBSHzH9.jpg) and it seems good but I haven't very thoroughly tested with it. Have all this in the [plugins](https://i.imgur.com/7wt6cjF.jpg) [section.](https://i.imgur.com/k3xkY0W.jpg)

That was relating to a different problem

In most current cases, it's really just the fact that the protocol is not implemented yet

For symbolic linking look into a depreciated software called:

1 : 2022-05-18
Hell yeah brotha! send me a pm and I'll link my discord to ya. maybe bounce ideas back and forth over what we can do with the board. but I feel that, I do feel like I'm always breaking stuff .

 honestly I tend to prefer running this sort of environment on hardware. especially since I have the system availability to do it.  I've run vm's in the past but yeah I do like having it on the native hardware. 

affirmative I work for a local tech shop so I was using one of my standard recovery usb's loaded with 11. to be fairrrrrr I probably should have just left the stick as 10 instead of remaking it for 11. but I've been running 11 since release. I really don't mind it. sure there are lots of little annoyances but windows release doesn't. but you are probably right in that I should roll back to 10. not like I keep any data on that system other than games anyways. I think the way I partitioned it is was is causing my issues. I had the drive in two partitions of roughly 500gb each. one holds games and the other was holding system stuff. definitely think when macrium moved everything over it didn't get the efi partitions correctly. so potentially I think removing the two partitions and starting completely fresh will do the trick. I'll update when I figure it out.

honestly as far as error reporting goes, I usually just hit up my buddy since he has the highest tier access to that Microsoft subscription thing that gives you access to legitimate technicians and support and a key for all kinds of server/windows installations. He tends to get a little more information than I do. very helpful when I've done something royally stupid .

right on! I will never turn down assistance. my coworker and I were gonna work on it tonight once we get off in 30 min. we can get linked up in disc.

Check out the readme in the github repo I posted above, theres a decent walk through there. Flippers file management is a little weird, not sure if its a bug or the way its designed but make sure you go to the file browser (rather than nfc section in the main menu) or you wont see files loaded onto your sd card

Huh weird, I was watching the qFlipper screen this time while installing the new driver, and it did show up briefly under recovery mode with a big blue Repair button, but then it disappeared again followed by "Connect your flipper."
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
I totally agree. Having a good keyboard is like having a good set of tires on your car, and as someone who spends a LOT of time typing, it is a profound difference between the cheap keyboards, and the Mountain keyboard I am currently typing on.

My only potential disagreement is simply that the return on investment is like most things in tech. I saw an amazing difference stepping up to a $150 Leopold mech keeb, but it only showed me that I wanted different switches. The difference between the Cherry Silver and the Cherry Blues I am currently typing on is apparent, and I find the blues better now. Going back to a membrane keyboard doesn't appeal anymore. But any more than about $300 and the actual features that are present over something like this Mountain seem less and less important. I can hot swap, do macro, control media, detach my 10key... all for under $300. But... like audio, sometimes you just need that last several hundred dollars to "feel" the way you want to.

TLDR: You do you friend, mech keeb is a lifestyle.

* Used it a lot as a universal Amiibo for my Animal Crossing cards
* Copied my sub-Ghz remote for the light on my ceiling fan
* Used the sub-Ghz to debug my weather monitor so I can have it imported into Grafana/InfluxDB via rtl\_433 and nodeRed
* Set it up to be used as a backup U2F on a few sites (Yubikey is still my #1 for this)
* Copied the 125khz RFID for my cat's food bowl - just for testing purposes
* saved a few Infrared remotes for use around the house.
* I'm gonna pop some Tesla
got a flipper in my pocket

Thats cuz you guys have a background in it. Im clueless and have no idea where to start learning even lol

One of the reasons I never use discord. It just confuses the crap out of me lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
I like this! Great idea, is there a link that teaches you how that you used or are u just naturally awesome that way?

Would love to do that.

I've run unleashed and middle of, but honestly I've always returned to the official firmware.  Even when I've run the others, I've never found any signals outside those that are allowed by the FCC, so having them available doesn't make sense, and they generally freeze more in my experience.

That being said, I have the official GitHub forked down to my gitlab instance, and any changes I submit automatically go through a build, so once I have more time I want to make my own flavor.  Tweak some of the XP gains, add more levels, and maybe work on rumored dumb mode and virtual pet aspect.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Thats exactly what I didnt feel like searching for.

You'll need a modified firmware to send those signals. I'm using the Unleashed firmware (https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware). You can download the DFU file and use the Flipper update utility to flash the file you download from the release area (https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/releases).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Ah ok thanks!
I'll setup a system to do that this evening.

Thank you!

Super easy. I basically posted the instructions below in another comment.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Pretty easy for any firmware.

git clone blah.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd firmwaredir
make

And if you have all the prerequisites, it'll drop a DFU file in the ./dist folder and you can load that using qFlipper or other means.

Apparently there is also a firmware that combines the features of MuddledBox and Unleashed that has a current release.
https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Oh, I wasn't seeing the precompiled ones.
I'll try compiling it tonight.
Never done that before, will be an interesting Learning experience.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
I'm running [Unleashed](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware). It's got a healthy Discord community and is updated frequently. [Muddledbox](https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware) is abandoned. Have not tried [Wetox](https://github.com/wetox-team/flipperzero-firmware) or [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins).

I didn't compile Unleashed -- I just downloaded the DFU from the releases page. There have been a few minor tweaks in the past few days, but any game changers?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Anyone have a good guide on putting the unleashed firmware on?  I am good on Linux/Mac but have a track record of bricking things.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
There's releases you can download, but I compiled it because it didn't appear that there was a release for the latest commit
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
We really got to compile it first?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Please contact the developers of your firmware fork. We do not condone enabling illegal features on the Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Unleashed has everything Muddledbox has and more. Its a no brained after I made the switch myself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Im still just running stock + Muddle. I have yet to compile for Unleashed, it has been a hot minute since I played with code and I am dangerously ditzy so far this week.

They don't make it clear in the video, but there are two relay components: the car side and the phone side. These components communicate with each other over other means, and as long as the added latency introduced by this middle communication doesn't exceed 80ms, there's no reason the distance couldn't be infinite. The researchers were using local wifi, however, and not an internet connection, so the ability to conduct this over long ranges with the internet connecting the relays is hypothetical, but supported by evidence.

For custom FW I recommend Unleashed, it's my personal favorite out of the current ones. (I'll post links to all below to everything) 

I have been having fun opening Tesla charging doors and made someone yell at Tesla support because of it plus my coworkers and I were dying laughing. Also, I have been saving NFCs, adding music, and IR remotes as well. 

It's all about building it to your needs really in my option; However, don't try to clone your cars key fob unless it's an older car as it will desync your current fob.

Doesn't the relay run out of range eventually, or is he somehow cloning the signal and replaying it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Totally.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Seems like a simple enough feature to port over.

Awesome! Mine arrives today as well.

1 : 2022-05-18
Fingers crossed!

Not supported at this time with stock firmware.
Possibility in the future or with custom firmware.

What I've done with mine so far;

Turn up/down volume on restaurant/bar TVs because they were too loud or I was trying to hear the game

Mess with my bar owner friend's Touchtune's jukebox, lower the volume at other bars because there wasn't anyone in that zone but me and my friends and we were trying to talk

BadUSB to open Geektyper in full screen and freak out my coworker because they thought their passwords were being stolen

Put my son's Amiibo's for his Nintendo Switch all in one place so he doesn't risk losing them

Cloned my credit card but haven't tested to see if it will work with touchless pay yet. Going to try the next time I get gas.

When Security+2.0 is implemented I'm going to try to store the 8 overhead doors at my work so I can control them all without going through 8 remotes. Same with my home garage.

Hoping to eventually clone my car key FOB without desyncing the original

I like that MuddledBox has the little buzz and beep when you send a signal but other than that, Unleashed seems to be better maintained and updated more often.

Interestingly, I used my Flipper right out of the box yesterday - no SD card, no firmware update - and it read both my work IDs really quickly.  After I updated, it only read one of them, and it seemed a lot harder to pick up for some reason (I had to put it in a very specific area of the card, vs yesterday where it didn't have to be too close). I'm wondering about flashing an older firmware to see if it picks up so I can at least try to add the one it won't read manually.

I dont know your knowledge level so this is a somewhat generic statement: With wifi and Bluetooth/BLE youre going to want to study the protocols, heavily. Pretty much anything other than PHY level attack (jamming) or basic spoofing/MITM (which probably wont be very successful against a properly secured network and client) is going to require some level of knowledge there. Lots of fun stuff you can do once youre doing stuff like crafting your own frames and injecting them into the air.

Know of any amiibo nfc downloadable libraries?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
I'm an absolute noob so please forgive me - I have the instructions for linking a new remote with my car (in this case, Honda HR-V). So from what I understand, I go into Sub-Ghz and Add Manually? From there though, I have no idea if I'm picking, for example, Princeton_433, Nice Flo, CAME etc. According to the instructions, the new remote (in this case, the Flipper) just has to send a LOCK signal within five seconds of the native key remote placing the car into remote programming mode, but I'm not sure how to generate a new LOCK signal and I can't seem to clone the native one anyways.

I seriously like you and haven't met you.
You literally do the same stuff I do.
I don't mess things up, I break them.

I'd run a VM tbh.
Dual boot gets complicated.

In terms of windows not loading.....are you doing it from USB?
Make a new ISO with widows 10 then upgrade to 11. 11 has so many issues.

Let me know if that fixes the windows issue.
Make sure to report errors in the actual forum, not git, not here, not Discord.

I'll attempt to get my environment setup to help.
I personally couldn't figure out how to get docker installed in Ubuntu and don't like it on windows.
Kind of a VM in a VM

This honestly just made my morning! thank you for the comment. but yeah had quite a few "post tests" for sure . let me know what kind of of luck you have with your dev board. because I'm still not even sure what do with it now . I saw quite a few alternate firmware's in discord that might be interesting but that will bring me back to my problem of trying to get everything running with python. 

honestly would have tried it with linux. went to put it together over the weekend. however when I migrated my main drive to my faster one with macrium reflect. long story short I dorked up something and cant get windows to boot, even a fresh install of 11 pro. with or without the second drive.  but that's a problem for another day.  so once I get that laptop fixed ill probably use that linux drive as my secondary drive on that system as originally planned assuming I can get the sn850 fixed. yeah really want make that my main environment for thins kind of stuff. 

anyways really enjoyed you're post, I hope you have a great day!

It's often hit or miss with the universal remote. When I'm out and about, I'm only concerned with turning off the TV's.

I've got an RCA universal remote. You could probably change the codes on it as needed and store the signals you want.

Well it was worth a shot, I hope you find how to fix it. Maybe also try asking in the official Flipper Zero discord as well.

I managed to get this working! I believe this was  mostly an issue with rebooting my Switch.  In any case, I flashed the Flipper Unleashed firmware, power cycled my Switch, and poof -- all the Amiibos!

While it's hardcoded and cannot be changed in the OTP memory, you can change by modifying the FW running on your flipper.

This can be done by forking the Official Firmware, then changing the following line:(Line 278 of furi\_hal\_version.c)

[https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/f6384116a1e501d2925013f6fae7e1d7cb6786cb/firmware/targets/f7/furi\_hal/furi\_hal\_version.c#L278](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/f6384116a1e501d2925013f6fae7e1d7cb6786cb/firmware/targets/f7/furi_hal/furi_hal_version.c#L278)

You would want to change this to your desired line to the following to achieve your desired name:   
`return "NameYouWant";`
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-18
Honestly I'm just enjoying reading this because it feels like something I would do and say.
Quick question, did you smack yourself I'm the head?
I call that the self POST test.
Best advice, use Discord and report all issues to the forum.
You're further than me.
Have not had time to even play with my flipper or setup the environment. 
Have you tried Linux or docker?
Just asking. 

Edit:
Of course he knew this, he's mentioning Discord. 

Ok got past that point, next step.

Edit: ugh I stepped on a land mine in a baby nursery, give me a second.

Ok. I'm back.

No, seriously, you're learning mistakes and amazing documentation will help the next you, me, us, them.

So good news, there is a fork that includes the app and a universal remote. Essentially the same app. 

Even easier to install as well as it's already built into a dfu.

1 : 2022-05-17
You aren't "supposed" to. But you can via unofficial firmware I believe if you really want to. Just make sure you write down the original as they use it as a sort of serial number I believe.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Ordered just buy a $8-$10 16-32gb one? SanDisk EXTREME 32gb is only $11 16gb Industrial is $13 They recommend one of the name brands for compatibility with the method they use if I remember correctly.

Hi OP,

1. Download program called Zadig

2. Open it as administrator

3. In one of the top menus, select "list all devices"

4. View what devices it lists currently, then switch your flipper to the DFU mode and connect it, then review the list again to see what was added (flipper) and select it.

5. Verify that the ID values are: 

6.  In "replace with" select "WinUSB driver".

7. Click replace and patiently wait...

8. After a successful replacement, try normally running update as you attempted so far...

I used the brute files. I didn't even know they had a PIN feature! We just go to the admin menu on the juke (via a button inside the machine) and there's a selection to pair a new remote, and you hold down the mic volume button, and it's learned. 

I do believe some of ours are likely set at 000, and a few are custom. I will look at how to change the pin in the juke settings tomorrow at work

I always wanted to know what I could use The badusb feature (I don't know how to program and have no idea where to start looking)

I just wish there was an easy way to just download and install stuff made by the community like from an app store style website so that us not so technically savvy people can download them and try cool fun things.

Also if you don't mind me asking what would the frequency scanner be useful for? (Still learning)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
I should probably point out that I'm just using the stock frequency that came installed on the fan and remote - I didn't personally set it for an apparently illegal frequency

For me, it picks up the signal if I set it at frequency 303.87 as CAME 12bit, but it won't let me send the signal saying "This frequency can only be used for RX in your region".  I also don't see a way to erase the saved ones I made (they don't work and I used up perfectly good names). Same thing with Read RAW - it again picks up the signal as evidenced by the meter/graph, but refuses to send for the same reason. I can't delete that saved one either.

I just love using it for opening and closing my garage door. One the reasons I purchased it was because I lost my garage door opener. It feels very convenient to have my garage door opener and office keycard on one device. I wish the security key mode worked better. I really want one of those. In the meantime I thrilled to finally own a badUSB. It always seemed like a lot of money for something that is essentially a toy. The frequency scanner could prove to be immensely useful when the firmware gets improved. It's like a Swiss army knife or some such thing. It replaces so many other gadgets.

My flipper in Recovery Mode was recognized in sound devices as an Guillemot STM DFU Device

Delete these 2 folders
-C:\Program Files\Guillemot
-C:\Program Files(x86)\Guillemot
Go to Device Manager, uninstall the Guillemot STM DFU Device.
Reboot
Try updating Flipper as normal.
At this point that rouge driver should not take over and the proper driver should work as intended. Im assuming from my minimal research that this rouge driver was from a sim racing peripheral that i used. Not sure which one though. Hope this helps.

I've been encountering a similar issue with a remote for my chilipad bed cooler. After some research I found [this article](https://foo-manroot.github.io/post/gnuradio/sdr/2017/11/18/gnuradio-ook.html). This is for a demonstration using a PC and SDR but the information about the signal could be relevant. I still haven't been able to get my remotes signal to show up on the flipper yet but I believe it is because of the data packet style signal this article references.
-------------------------------

It's weird - it seems to pick up the device just fine in normal mode, but as soon as it's in recovery mode, it's no longer recognized.  I do have an SD card installed and reinstalled qFlipper also.  It's wacky!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Emulating credit cards is outside its capabilities though, as the protocol involves a cryptographically secure component on the card that cannot be read (assuming the credit card is anywhere close to modern)

This all sounds perfectly normal. I'm envisioning this goal. Can we construct a scenario where the flipper will clone the fob and also clone the car. The flipper would then use one tool to trigger/advance/open the fob. Then use the second tool to emulate to car to help the fob advance to the next rolling code.

Note Format:  
`&lt;duration&gt;&lt;note|rest&gt;&lt;sharp&gt;&lt;octave&gt;&lt;dots&gt;`  
duration: number between 1 &amp; 128, defaults to project duration. Ex: 4 is a quarter note, 2 is a half note.  
note: A through G or P for pause (rest)  
sharp: # or omitted  
octave: between 1 &amp; 16, defaults to project octave  
dots: between 1 &amp; 16 '.' characters. Each dot makes the note half again as long.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

8C4  - Eight note pitch of C, fourth octave

4A#5. - Dotted quarter note pitch of A sharp, fifth octave

2P - Half note rest
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Edit: changed out the notes that were supposed to be a dotted half tied to a half to dotted half and a half note rest. I couldn't figure out a good way to get a 5-beat note. If someone figures out a way, please let me know.

In short, yes, one can create a clock, BUT you risk it getting out of sync with no real way to re-sync without an external device. 

Think the clock app (client) runs on the flipper 
Then every time you plug it into your computer it re-syncs the time OR you create or integrate the clock app with the Bluetooth device and re-sync that way.

If you have uninstalled it and all files have been removed I would restart your computer. After that try to download a older version of qFlipper to see if it works.

If that doesn't work maybe your antivirus could be blocking it for some reason (if you have one), if you can whitelist it or turn it off temporally. 

If the following two above still doesn't make it work I would see if you have any Windows updates or anything like that, I don't think that would work but it's worth a shot.

Talked about this in an earlier post. Flipper can't clone rolling codes and will desync them trying to emulate them, but you can still read, save, and emulate the 1 out of 10,000 for example tho.  

The way I have found to fix this is to take it to a dealer and say it died (or some other excuse) and it stopped working. This worked for someone else when they encountered the same issue with their car.

Right now the Flipper supports only reading the unencrypted DESFire data, and implementing decryption/writing would be tricky due to the sheer length of the key. Your best bet at cloning those is to get a proxmark3, it supports desfire much better due to its CLI-centric design
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Basically, unless you have an AES/DES key to a DESFire card, you can't clone it. Unlike the Mifare Classic, the DESFire is cryptographically secure and you can't read protected data from it unless you know the key

Ive been playing around with my flipper and found a weird situation. If I add a files through the flipper the files are shown in main menu, archive, iPhone app and qflipper. If I add files through qflipper they are only visible via archive and qflipper. 

Files seems to emulate just fine so not a huge deal just annoying.

hey cam, Try pressing "Read" then clicking the left button for "Config." Now adjust the freq. down to 304.25. If the modulation doesn't work, just try them all.

I know the feels... Though I will also say it's super simple in the device. One of the first things I did was to open the little guy up to judge how difficult it was to poke around in there (spoiler: not difficult at all).

Good luck!

Did you try turning it off, then turning it on then trying to run it again?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
We are not a Russian company and the conflict has no impact on our ability to produce and deliver devices

And that's why the flipper doesn't emulate dynamic protocols.

The counter in the car has probably been advanced by you trying to hack it, but the counter inside the remote stayed at the same number. Try clicking the fob button for a while, maybe you'll manage to advance the fib counter so that it matches the car's again

When you are charging via USB at the computer, try running qFlipper and see if the device is recognized as connected. If so, try pressing the &lt; and back buttons together.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Have you tried reinstalling it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
If you locking with pin then USB is disabled.
Also full drive encryption is not really good option, instead we encrypt the most important things like U2F keys.

Which mean the "ethical hacking" reasoning is no longer valid.  

And it's sill bad to exploit it to make a profit from posting videos.

And it's still asshole behavior to intentionally interfere with others' property.

You want to use it on your own Tesla or a Tesla owned by someone you've obtained permission from?  That's ethical and not being an asshole.

Except Tesla looked at this exploit and said it was a feature.

&gt;** DISPUTED ** Certain Tesla vehicles through 2022-03-26 allow attackers to open the charging port via a 315 MHz RF signal containing a fixed sequence of approximately one hundred symbols. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that the behavior is as intended.

Mine is having the exact same issue. Just received it today.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
I believe I got this on Amazon. I'm not sure if this specific product can be found anymore, but [here](https://www.amazon.com/Yeebline-Charger-Aluminum-Charging-Compatible/dp/B07Q21TS6X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21019JD03335S&amp;keywords=USB-C+stand&amp;qid=1652771416&amp;sprefix=usb-c+stan%2Caps%2C144&amp;sr=8-3)'s a similar one. I originally got this to dock an SSD drive without realizing the data transfer speed will be bottlenecked on these stands as most of 'em are simply not fast enough to contest with USB 3+(rookie mistake). As for using to read/write these MicroSD cards, I don't think I find it to be all that noticeably bothersome. I do notice the silicon case for the Flipper Zero sort of gets in the way of docking, however.

Yea I got one with someone sitting in it at the grocery store. I guess they can close it because it kept closing almost immediately after I opened it. I wish I could have heard them.

I was trying to avoid cutting my pet dolphin open but I guess it has to be done. For his own sake!

Yeah that was my next thought. I'd pop it open and test it with a multimeter. See what the voltage is. Worse case you have to buy a similar sized battery or even scarier, force charge the battery
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Yup!

I've charged this device before with no issues via PC port and phone charger. But suddenly those methods don't seem to work. I don't see how my power bank could've ruined the electronics so I'm very weirded out.

The USB-C port doesn't seem loose. Maybe a faulty battery in my unit?
-------------------------------

This, my Zipcar card, and my Initial D IC card didn't scan. Really hoping to be able to emulate these soon.

Have you tried using a different cable by chance?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Thanks for the response!

I tried charging via USB from my PC and using my phone and laptop charger, but the screen remains black and still no LED.

I also tried the last tip/trick, but no joy :'(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-17
Try charging it from a computer USB port. Battery banks are weird in the way they look for a current draw. The flipper is such a little device I bet it isn't pulling enough of a load on the power bank for it to wake up and send it full power. I know that may sound weird but I have the same problem with my Lora beacons and my deauther. 

Tldr: flipper is so small it might not pull enough current to wake the portable charger. Try a wall adapter or PC port.

Bonus, try plugging the power bank into your phone then quickly swapping the cable to the flipper. It has worked for me in the past.

I had to update the NFC dictionary file in the NFC assets folder.  I was unable to get all the keys until I did that, it can take a few min to get all of them though so keep that in mind.

Theres a couple posts in the official Discord about it and the unleashed firmware has the update file as well, although I dont know if it actually gets updated when you install it.  But should be able to just download it from the unleashed GitHub if you navigate to the NFC assets folder

Tl;dr for everyone;

Apple gonna Apple. 

I kinda figured something like this was gonna be the case, but, Id rather consult and be able to know more than to Google and be left more confused.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-16
Hey, so I know a thing or two about developing on apple platforms.

Generally, things like opening a USB serial session in an iOS app requires that the hardware device is MFi certified, which the flipper is not. Additionally, transferring a file over serial bluetooth also requires a MFi license and auth chip. BTLE does not, but there are pretty constraining data limitations on packet payloads with BTLE. 

If I had to guess, these are the major bottlenecks that hold back "update firmware from the app" functionality on Apple devices.

I went to the main flipper Github page but I do not see any repos or anything called MuddledBox and searching gives 0 results. If its not to much trouble can you point me in the right direction ? 

(Thanks in advance!)

Hey! Found a light security issue/feature request. You are not prompted to input your pin when you power off the device and turn it back on. 

Also, I know that you can just plug the device into your computer and access the files, it seems small but it would be cool to see  some sort of password prompt from the desktop app as well. Im not sure how tough it would be to add sd card encryption?

Thoughts for the future/community. So far its been a pretty cool product to play with!

I had a similar problem. During the Firmware update, I read you need to have an SD card inserted. I inserted mid firmware update (fail) and got a black screen and the LEDs didn't light up. I tried  everything here and didn't work:

[https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/KeyCombo.md](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/KeyCombo.md)

Tried different USB cables and still didn't work. At the time when plugging and unplugging, this was on my Windows computer. When switching to my Mac, the qFlipper quickly recognized that it needed to be repaired and I easily repaired it, and is working fine now.

This is the exact same problem I have with mine but even opening it up and checking for anything loose, out of place didnt sort it out. Ive sent a couple emails to the team but still waiting for a reply. Im sure theres tons of emails they have to sort through. 

I saw the other posts to get to the CLI and check the battery levels and such and everything looks good so not sure why it wont power up unless its connected to external power.

To everyone looking for the files, google is a wonderful thing. Main words you need to search are flipper zero Tesla.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-16
Well I dont know too much about the SubGhz transceiver in the flipper. Most car tags are UHF because of the distance it can read a tag. Out of the box it for sure cannot interact with UHF. The transceiver might be capable? Im not too sure of all the frequencies its capable of.

Ah ha!! I think I remember (vaguely) what the issue was! I don't think it was for U2F in general, but the ability to use the U2F feature for such things as unlocking windows etc (windows current gives a "This key is not supported" warning when you try to set it up)

.....anyone have tips on *THIS*? As far as random sites that use U2F I've had no problems setting everything up, so this must've been what they were talking about in the post I saw before.....as to how or why it won't work, or what possible fixes there may be though I'm stumped 

Anyone able to give any more info/ideas??

Can always borrow a friend's Hack RF and see which frequency it's transmitting off of.  I've found the FZ is hit or miss with car remotes, even older ones.  I figured they were outside of the range and even when you do capture a transmission, it may not work depending on the car.

Thank you for super quick reply, very excited to see where the devs and community can take this thing!

I think I figured it out. When you copy the fob and try to use it, it makes the rolling code in the car tick over one which makes it desynced from the fob. But apparently you can walk out of distance with the fob, click it a bunch to cycle through, and then it should work because if the fob is ahead of the car the car will resync to the fob.

Thank you for the suggestion - I gave Read Raw a try but didn't have any luck... will continue to play around with it.

It's going to be really cool once they release the custom FW for sniffing signals, then setups like this can be used for some cool wardriving.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-16
To be completely honest I am not 100% sure. I can guess it overrides or tries to wipe and then rewrite but being rolling  it can't due to needing the key. 

here is my original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/u922ur/car\_key\_cloning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/u922ur/car_key_cloning/)

Atwood Rope makes dyneema micro cord. It's scary strong, I've used it to climb trees. They also have an impressive selection of standard micro cord; glow in the dark, obnoxious neon colors, etc. Made in the USA.

And even then, like most vehicles, you can just manually overpower the motor clutch and lift the flap. If someone were going to vandalize it, they are going to vandalize it. If left open for some time (about 30s) without plugging in the door will close when the car goes to sleep.

Meh. It is what it is. I finally got mine after two years of waiting am I couldnt be happier. I use it multiple times a day. So much fun.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-16
Yay!  I bet you $80 it comes on time *(within 1 day +/-)* OR $160 that it comes 2+ days early.  If you lose you still *win* because you'll have your flipper!  _*(does ANYthing about those wagers make sense?  I don't really understand multi-layer betting...)*

Anyway, If you aren't a technological idiot maybe you can tell me how to use it?  --  I actually did IT subcontracting for a while but I was just a window cleaner and I'm only just trying to wrap my head around doing stuff w/ Python at all/for the first time to connect the wifi board and Flipper to the internet. *(I can see the board itself wirelessly @ blackmagic.local or something like that but I've gotta do some stuff that's over my head to upload/inject code to the Flipper to actually make it connect to the board)* --  

...I just barely understand enough to almost be able to get started in a bunch of different places but keep getting almost immediately stumped.  I've finally read a tiny bit about jailbroken/cracked/whatever... Flipper OS' and how they open up access to a lot more functionality but I figure that's a step too far when my knowledge/ability is currently so low.  

It very genuinely is an educational device to me above all else *(whether I wanted it to be or not...)* 

I can read bank cards but get some furi.check/failure/whatever...-then-reboot when trying to save and I don't seem to be able to save any garage codes *(or maybe just the rotating codes)* but I also either get an error or the save button does nothing/etc...  --  I get nothing from my state ID and it's from 2019 and has the star in the upper right/is a "Real" ID and I was nearly *positive* they had RFIDs...  

I'm done buggin ya though, sry.  Maybe just remember this/post something back in a few weeks/months if/when you're doin awesome/flyin' like a breeze w/ your new Flipper and have some brilliant hacks/move you wanna share!

After seeing /Beneficial_Ease8865 posting about copying their fan remote, I thought I'd try mine - the frequency analyzer shows the remote transmitting at around 304MHz, but that frequency does not seem to be an option for me when I go to "Read" -  what should I be looking for?

search for finger strap lanyards or the ringke fingerstrap. either of these are small enough to clasp to some keychains or carabiner without being too unwieldy or too long like a wrist strap.

fingerstrap lanyards have the ability to loosen or tighten after wrapping around something. very utilitarian.

the ringke ring is an ergonomic silicone ring and matches well with the flipper.

Heyo, I cracked it open and I think the issue was the contacts at the back of the board assembly weren't fully engaged with the backplate. Simply unscrewing and re-screwing my back-plate resolved all my issues.

Since then I've been able to shutdown, restart, and even recover from unrelated hard-faults without having to open it up again.

Guys I have figured it out. 

It is possible to get your stuff working without the actual remote, you just need to look very hard on the internet. If your hardware is old you might run issue that a lot of tools you want to access is no longer available, but in my case I was able to find an excel spreadsheet, with abundance of keys for my specific ceiling fan, and different corresponding functions. As long as you know the frequency (which you can look up on FCC website), the key is the only thing you need to make it work.

Nothing crazy just had to play with it a bit I narrow it down to 315 and tried all the an frequency I found that it's best to record the action live my issue was I was trying to do it inside but I'm assuming there is a code sent to and from since it's rolling but after a bit it worked out just fine one all 5 garages. I was actually able to record the frequency of some across the street opening there garage from about 15 from the door. Tested it after it closed and poof profit. Not recommended ethically but it's a thing.

If you have all the specs of the remote, I'm presuming you also have a model number for the fan/remote? You can probably find a picture displaying the FCC-ID and look it up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
Right, what I am currently trying to do: I have a ceiling fan that I do not have a remote for, I have all the specifications for the remote, so I am wondering since there is a way to edit the .sub files. Maybe there is a way to replicate a remote within the specifications that the fcc provides, without having the physical remote.  Unless there is a specific protocol or key which can not be acquired online. Any knowledge on this?

I think people waiting can get a head start by building a pwnagotchi, if they havent already. 

People spending $400+ on it cant possibly know the tech isnt worth that much and they can build their own for that pricereally theyre just falling for hype. Hell its open source

It kinda looks like it failed to emulate what you just made there at the end?

I've noticed on mine, running the unleashed firmware now, that if I have that dolphin screen where he jibbering Japanese and then swims away I get a handful of odd issues like this. 

If I go to the settings and reboot and then "flipper OS" the swimming dolphin animation goes away and generally so do the odd emulation issues.

Possibly, but for now the only software directly available for it is the Blackmagic debugger.

That said, the ESP32-S2 is a pretty powerful SoC. Lots of open source projects/platforms _should_ work on it just fine, with a bit of board-specific config. And with any software running on the dev board theres probably some work to do when it comes to properly interfacing with the Flipper firmware for user control. Not a ton of work but still work that needs to be done by someone with the right skills/experience.

Theres been some talk on the discord about getting ESP32 Marauder firmware running on the board, which may be the kind of thing youre looking for. If youre interested in that kind of thing you should hop in the #wifi-devboard channel on the discord and join in the chat. :)

Is there going to be a Kickstarter for Flipper One?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
It also copied the fan speeds(1,2,3) and fan\_off.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
Nope, but it just says megacode.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
I mean when its reading the signal from the read option.  It should say Keeloq, Security+, etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
It's just a code transaction over 318Mhz 24 bit.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
Please contact support@flipperdevices.com and tell them about your issue
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
It's very outdated and probably isn't compatible with the current firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
It's sniffing the RF transaction of the code between the remote and the garage door mechanism. I did not inject it. Same way with kali Linux you would sniff wifi passwords on above Ghz frequency.

Didn't know we had that option. I got the notification text messaged to me, and was home for the "delivery" and nom flipper was in the mailbox. Regular mail no package.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-15
I also got another email saying my flipper just shipped but with the same tracking number on it saying it was delivered last month. Same tracking number I followed to have nothing in my mailbox. Like I'm being taunted....

How did you get the directory structure under your subghz folder to function? Any subfolders that I add don't show up on the Flipper.

Micro Paracord. Check it out. Or you can pull para cord apart and use one of the 7 inner lines that are twisted together. A small key ring like what's attached to a small flashlight so you have a larger hole to play with. Lol to use to attach a lanyard....

You would add it to the application folder of the uncompiled firmware source code and then compile it to a DFU file on your own machine instead of downloading the pre-compiled DFU from Releases.

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LK4LVMB?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LK4LVMB?th=1)

This stuff is rather strong and you can use it for just an attachment loop and use paracord or something thing else as often you want something thicker for comfort.

I made sure to enable the phone number updates, so, as soon as it hit a local hub, I marked it for pickup only.

So at least on mime the lock button works because the flipper can go that rounded range. I can dial it down enough for unlock. I have seen the dev board has more antenna features. I might look into that.

How do you put muddled version on flipper?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-14
The only limitation is the persons ability to tell it what to do. From a hardware perspective there isnt a device in existence to match it. Its so versatile and designed really well.

The more people learn how to contribute to the software side the better it is for everyone. I look at it as an SDK, the developers put the foundation together along with the hardware and as a hacking tool you can expand it to what you want to do. 

Anyone who doesnt have the time to truly learn whats going on and how things work were never interested in hacking and instead expected it to be some kind of Harry Potter magic wand.

I just got mine and had the same issue. Updated firmware and still didn't work so decided it was time to check the battery make sure it didn't come loose during transport. Took the back off and it started working so I'm guessing it was some how grounded to itself. Try that out OP

It's been more than 5 months since they were available to order. Maybe if they end up with extras after all orders are filled they will sell those. But after that it's a question of when they can get parts to start selling them to new orders.

Have I checked my mailbox? I didn't think of that.... Just teasing. I did immediately when I got the notification it was delivered. Our mailman is pretty consistent with drop offs. My mail box is a check-in spot for them. There's a bat code in it they need to scan do the post office knows if they are on schedule. It's also checked out from the camera on my front door.

I'll take that as a compliment. 
Thought experiment since some of us are using critical thinking and looking out for others, some neither of the former.

Ever think that publicly posting something illegal can trace back to you?
That you've given video evidence and intent of culpability?

That I don't know someone with base level SOINT skills has your username, which then led to your email, then your phone number, then address?

No one I can see is saying don't do things with this amazing device.
I'm autistic and I can read between the lines here.
Maybe don't post your trial evidence for the world to see.

What will be funnier than this video is the one with the tears after you get hit with the government Hacking laws and can't touch a calculator for the next decade. 

Now, that will be a funny video. Send me that one.

I highly highly doubt you will be able to order one for some time. I was a backer and got mine last month and just got a tracking number for a pre-order one. Youre best bet is 3rd party sellers but let me just tell you thiswhatever people are charging it isnt worth it. Just recognize that you want it because of a feeling and people are attempting to exploit you for that. The flipper is a cool tool but it is at the end of the day a tool. Dont go blowing crazy money to get it only to do what so many others have done, stop using it after a couple weeks and sell it.

The more we screw with other people's property and record how we're doing it, the more people will distrust and be aware of the tool we're using.

 I say this not to OP, but to the reader who sees this video and plans on replicating the video. 

This doesn't come from a place of anger. Only concern.

The FCC actively monitors for things that go for miles like ham radio or commercial bands.

Latest update says its still with customs unfortunately 

https://ship.flipp.dev/

&gt;	13 May 15:08
 Good news: we delivered 96% of Canadian orders, American Wave3 batch is already in the US and passed the customs, the numbers above are not broken anymore. We are planning to publish the long-awaited blog update about the next batches tomorrow.

&gt;	 Not so good news: Australian batch is STILL under customs, it's been 20 days. I wish we could speed this up, but everything is fine from our side...
-------------------------------

I ordered one with mine, then recently placed an order for 2 more modules. They said the modules were in stock, but it's been 2 weeks and they haven't shipped or answered emails... 

So who knows what the delay will be...

I didn't order one when i grabbed my flipper. I wonder how long the wait times are now for an order of just the board. If i can get one i will def workout a new revision!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Thanks for sharing, it looks really cool.

I'm really impressed with the build quality of the flippers, but I may make a couple of these anyway, I love having appropriate cases for things even if they don't really need them! lol

Have you considered a revision with space for the wifi dev board?

Ok just to come back to this I used a couple other bins I sourced more reliably and they worked. No reset method needed. Make sure to reliably source your \*.bins
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Here's what I did that did NOT work so far.

Downloaded into VS: 

[https://github.com/Lucaslhm/AmiiboFlipperConverter](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/AmiiboFlipperConverter)

Ran script on a random amiibo bin i got off google. Converted fine to \*.nfc. Switch did not recognize it.

Tried to "reset" on the switch by going to settings&gt;amiibo&gt;reset . Still did not work.

Next tried a bin from [https://hax0kartik.github.io/amiibo-generator/](https://hax0kartik.github.io/amiibo-generator/) and went through the same steps. Still did not work.

Any Suggestions? Potentially a py error? User error?

I know I was a bit slow to get this model out. Hope everyone finds it useful. I wanted to recycle the foam inserts mine came with. This uses 3M screws but i may redesign the hinge with 2mm instead since it seems like it is going to eventually snap one day.

Reminds me of John Cavil from BSG:

"I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays! I want to hear X-rays! And I want to - I want to smell dark matter! Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can't even express these things properly because I have to - I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language! But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws! And feel the wind of a supernova flowing over me! I'm a machine! And I can know much more! I can experience so much more. But I'm trapped in this absurd body! And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way!"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Very good post imo. Still stings a bit seeing pre-orders where filled before backers but yeah. Really excited to get my hands on the device!

Lol, love it. Intent is a philosophical construct. My intent in most of life is just to gain enough knowledge and experience that on my deathbed I won't feel dissatisfied with the number of unknowns I'm aware of but never got to explore.

Technology has just made the depth of things to explore massive and expanding faster than I can keep up with so something like flipper has already and will be a major help in exploration. Imagine the breadboard work and signal research we'd have to go through to build one ourselves.

The tracking was off for me too. I got an email a month before it arrived with a tracking number that just said "delayed", until it was delivered. That was a week ago, and today I got an email saying my order has been shipped.
-------------------------------

Mine says it was delivered.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Sorry buddy as far as I can tell we're boned..... And it should have been placed in your mailbox. Awesome ending to a 2 year wait.. Good luck with your insurance claim.

Nice! I'm in the US and mine "shipped" April 30th with an estimated arrival date of May 19, but I just got an update and it should be in my mailbox tomorrow!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
I got the email on time watched the tracking number and saw it was delivered to my house. Nothing in the mail box..... I've already contacted flipper by Kickstarter, no response. By email - I can try to get a insurance claim on may 15, and on here a comms manager. Said they got it to USPS so it's not their fault.... Not impressed with customer service at all.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Thanks to the entire team for the dedication and transparency over these last 2 years. Its awesome seeing this product born from the community. The only thing I would question and complain is the lack of prioritization of the backers over the preorders. Doesnt feel right that people that ordered in feb already received theirs in April, and backers that are waiting for 2 years so far are still waiting. Thats the only decision that I think that might have been a mistake and created a lower satisfaction rate on your customers. Other than that, you and your team did a great job. I would still appreciate an apologize to the backers for allowing them to get hit with delaying issues over the pre orders.

Well wouldnt that just be a great way for this whole thing to endTalk about anticlimactic. It just sucks because had I gotten the shipping notification earlier, I would have been able to tell my friends to keep a sharp eye out. Or if I had been able to change my state of residence, I could have gotten it shipped straight to myself. Or something. Idk. Im just venting at this point because of the massive disappointment.

I got the same email, I thought it was odd since I've had my flippers a couple weeks. 

I have to admit I was a little excited they shipped me duplication order, but alas it was my old tracking number and was (correctly) showing as delivered.

It sticks well but not too well to be removed. You only need to heat the thicker stuff to form it around contours like on a bumper of a car.  It is pretty much like the cheaper screen protectors that are plastic film instead of the nicer glass ones.

If op has been using his garage opener on an illegal frequency for years.... Well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
Indeed this. In general repeated transmission,  and interference in the same location is what will eventually get you. If you were to keep moving and transmit only occasionally, the chance of getting into trouble really is minimal.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
If you cause interference on a regular basis and someone complains, there are ways to pinpoint the source of the interference.  This is so very extremely unlikely with the flipper transmitting for a couple seconds at a time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-13
I feel that if they sent yours off next week it would arrive to your doorstep before customs here has finished with the whole of Australia.

I have no data to back this up but Im purely guessing May 27th.  Again, I dont work with them so I have no inside baseball to base that off of.  I just want to make a guess and see if it ends up being right.

This is in Australia. We are still waiting on customs down here. So sad. Worst part is, I know someone in shipping who knows someone who knows someone. If it had of been sent by boat there's a chance that we'd be able to get it pushed up the line. There's a big backlog of containers coming in atm.

did it work?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-12
That will only work one time since the saved raw capture doesn't advance the rolling code. A fully supported TX for Security+ would advance the rolling code after each send.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-12
Okay, yes it does work. Ran across a Tesla today and it totally worked.

I was thinking that editing the .sub file with notepad was too easy of a solution, but damn if it didn't do the trick. Gave me a little bit of a chub, tbh.

The subghz engineer for flipper has said that they do not plan on including TX for rolling protocols due to fear of the device getting banned.

Doesnt work like that

This means that your garage door actually uses frequencies that it shouldn't. Allowing the flipper to transmit on such frequencies would be illegal and we won't be able to sell them in the US.

Please be aware that by using alternate firmwares to transmit on non-allowed frequencies you are breaking the law.
-------------------------------

Actually, as of [today's release (0.58.1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/uo2rp7/release_0581/) there is support for Security+ :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-12
Still haven't received an email for tracking still but I had an email to check overall status, the one including that your address is locked in.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-12
Lots of people say use different firmware, but if your garage door is rolling code (Security+, Security+ 2.0), Flipper currently doesn't support TX for that protocol, even if you use an unlocked firmware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-12

&gt;e a file for all major Freq. So far after testing, it works on most of the paid parking garages in my city.  
&gt;  
&gt;Does require unlocked firmware for the flipper though. It doesn't work on the standard firmware from qFlipper.

When I try to use these using latest Unleashed FW, I get a "Cannot Parse File" error.

With your flipper zero plugged into your computer, launch qFlipper. After it loads your flipper zero, select update from file. Go to downloads and select the latest version of MuddledBox. Edit for the software to upload to your flipper zero, then you are good to go. qFlipper will say update; DO NOT PRESS UPDATE. Doing so will reload the latest version of the stock firmware.

FWiW, mine said something similar the last time I'd checked the tracking in mid-April *(it was still in TN or LA and said "awaiting item")* and the predicted delivery time was late-April but then it just showed up almost a week early...  --  Do you have the case and/or the GPIO board as part of your order?

the charge door is just listening for a carrier frequency (usually emitted by the charge handle on a wall connector) by button press. It's not a secure signal at all except that the car has to be unlocked for it to work.

its almost like it tries to restart the RPC session before the flipper finishes rebooting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
I'm guessing it isn't tied to the car key at all. There is actually a button on the charging cables from Tesla to open the flap from the outside. It probably just imitates that universal signal. But Tesla's aren't that dumb. They won't just open the flap while driving down the road, or if they are already being charged.

The problem is using a tag thats valid. For most of the car washes here, the barrier is directly linked to a payment system with a user database with employees and customers. Youd probably just have to clone a tag that belongs to an employee/customer that obviously frequents to make it past.

Id assume just getting the barrier to raise would fail to trigger the car wash system to queue up your vehicle as in line for X tier wash.
-------------------------------

Im pretty sure. Hence test test!

1. Clone fiipper-firmware ([https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware))
2. Replace the following  `59` in `/applications/desktop/desktop.c` with:

&amp;#x200B;

    if(desktop-&gt;settings.pin_code.length &gt; 0) {
      desktop_pin_lock(&amp;desktop-&gt;settings);
      desktop_lock(desktop);
    }

3. Build and flash

I've copied my transit card (NFT) and I'll be testing it tonight. My car entry wont work, but that was to be expected. The newer ones are too secure, but I'm going to test my son's 12 year old car when I have the chance.

1 : 2022-05-11
Well you can't natively, but like you just said yes you can with third party firmware. 

I personally don't think the name is worth 210K, but my comment was about the fact you can once they learn about custom firmware with added features (such as name changes), unlocks, etc. 

Never said it was something you could do right out of the box.

I guess it's lazy of me but I'm sort of waiting for the community to spring into action and actually release firmware that can do something but you know we'll see what happens.

Bad USB has been the only thing that I've gotten to work successfully so far and it is kind of a neat curiosity but not much more.

ibuttons might be useful if I lived in Russia or something where people are still using those systems but they are not in wide use in the US I don't think at least I haven't seen one in a long time.

I can't get any of the NFC stuff to work although it will detect things it just won't emulate them properly and I couldn't get the universal second factor stuff working, or the garage door opener stuff. 

Still have yet to play around with the gpio.

The dolphins cute.

I have too. It's not a hard task at all to install the MuddledBox firmware to the F0 using qFlipper. Just two clicks and it's there. So I didn't see any downside to just doing it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
Often those garages will have a machine that accepts tickets/money for daily payers and a scan pad for monthly payers to scan a card/fob. I'm sure it would be easy to cheese those with a Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
Right? I'm a lil disappointed but I'm also just excited to find out what it will work for. I already saved all my NFC amibos lmaoo just cause i can, even tho i probably won't use them at all
-------------------------------

Ive seen a couple people say it works on the stock NA firmware but havent been able to try it myself yet. The file runs fine on my stock firmware but Ill have to find a Tesla to confirm. 

Thanks for the reply and happy hacking!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
Yes i understand and im patient, and not in a rush. I was asking if people thought it was something that could be updated or if the flipper just won't be capable of doing it because i think some key fobs just won't be able to be saved/read. But thanks i guess.

I actually bought one of the ones in the image...

Not sure why everyone's judging so hard, I missed the KS and even if I hadn't I'm in Europe so I would still be waiting a while. Meanwhile the one I bought on ebay is now sitting in front of me.

It's worth the money for me, maybe it isn't for you; I'm not sitting here judging people that can't afford it. Hell, if I was that bothered about the money I could have built one of my own from scratch using mostly stuff I have lying around, but that's not the point.

And FWIW, I hope the rest of you get yours soon. Sucks to be waiting this long.

even if your garage door opener uses rolling codes (as any secure ones do), you can still play with it using your FZ.  Just walk up the street until the opener no longer is in range / working.. then have your flipper record the raw signal.  (If you want to see it happen more than once, generate some more codes too and store those too but keep track of what order they are in and play them back in that order or it won't work).     Now walk back down to your house so you're in range and you can replay the signal in the FZ et voila, your door will open (and close again if you stored two).     Great fun!
-------------------------------

Lol.
I have the flipper as my backup token for a Google account, and used chrome.
I'm glad you got it working.
I'm still trying to figure out all the things I can do with U2F, FIDO, etc.
Just know it's not one technology to rule them all.
I suggested Only key because it can hold 24 slots on the key and do challenge response.
If you use the desktop application it can hold unlimited keys.
It also has self destruction mode.
If you're happy with what you got, then by all means.
The flipper is my backup device for tokens. Pretty neat feature for that U2F.
I'm going to backup the folder after seeing that other post.

Pull out the SD card. Open it from a computer. You should be able to see the "infrared" folder. Create sub-folders and sort your files.

To open the saved remotes, do it from the "browser". When you hit "down" from the home screen, you should see "sub-ghz". Hit right twice to get to "infrared" and navigate to the IR you want to use.

That's where I got the tracking number I believe. Unless they are giving out multiple tracking numbers? Wouldn't flipper support mention that? Maybe I'm wrong but after confirming my address I was given a tracking number to my parcel.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
And if there was info saying it was still at processing that's be great. But support took 3 days looking into where my order was and confirm it should have been delivered. From where the tracking number had traveled. There's not another label with my name and address on it. Flipper records show I have received it same as the post office. In 4 days I can try to make an insurance claim. That is only allowed after the confirmed delivery date
-------------------------------

The Yubikey 4 only supports U2F, not FIDO2. That version isn't sold any more. The Yubikey 5 will work wherever your OnlyKey works and a few more places besides.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-11
Little note, save the files in your u2f folder somewhere safe. I switched SD cards and it made new u2f keys so it no longer worked for sites I had already setup. Luckily I have a YUBIKEY and was just testing if the flipper one actually worked. I was able to copy the u2f files from the other SD card back to new SD card and it worked again.
-------------------------------

Yes, but all that does is store whatever unencrypted information is on the card. You will not be able to use your flipper to pay with the copied data from the card.

Yes ... so here's the thing about those security tokens.
I have 3.
Some browsers don't like it and I'm too lazy to TS that for myself. 
I know it varies based on the hardware token as well.
I have a Yubi 4 and a brand new Only Key.
The Only Keys works on everything, even Windows login. 
The Yubi does not.

It all depends on the maker of the key technology and the company you're trying to setup a key for (Google, git, Microsoft, etc.)
There's FIDO and U2F, they are not the same.

Highly advise looking into OnlyKey as it supports all of the above-referenced.

Just my two cents.

Hey, I just got my device so hang in there. The shipping info was busted until the day of delivery. Based on info in this thread you likely still have a few days until you get your order.

It's been a long time since we placed our Kickstarter orders, but the last few years have been long for a lot of reasons. Also IMO don't back Kickstarters if you can't handle delays. Unless it's very simple, it takes longer than they expect. It's a preorder of a new product so we eat all of the development delays you don't notice when you buy a product off the shelf.
-------------------------------

That's what I have, I had to go to the survey page to even know it was shipped, 10 days ago! I thought I was supposed to get an email when it shipped

Doubtful. There are already rules to enforce turning off devices that might interfere with aircraft operation. They will not ban a device without reason. Someone would have to seriously interfere with aircraft operations to get that level of effort out of the bureaucracy.

Check out fly fishing gear. They have heavy duty versions for things like pliers and other tools. 

They will cost more, but they are definitely better quality.

The 2 factor authentication is to replicate a physical key, like a Ubikey. Instead of entering a code from an app, text or email, you plug in a USB to authorize. It's definitely more secure than text or email codes, but probably about the same as using the app on my phone. An Ubikey is just a USB plug, no menus or anything else to deal with.

I can't get the app to control the device remotely. For me it's just a backup device and debugging tool.

It's definitely a bare bones device that is far more useful in the hands of people who know how to use it, I'm never going to come close it's potential. But as someone who is moderately technical that has issues with coding or scripting, the UX is very friendly and I've been collecting all sorts of signals and playing with any app that I can find a reason to.

I've also thought about building a dummy system for testing out signals. I'm good with physical building, and the parts to set up a basic lock system. I'm also not going to mess with my work security system, as tempting as it is. I used to work for a small company and the owners were very cool. When they installed a security system, they were OK when me and another guy wanted to try and circumvent it. She trusted us and always encouraged our curiosity (best boss ever). Essentially we red teamed the site, decades before I'd even learn that term. We never had a failed attempt, but we had inside knowledge and it was a basic system for alerting for a simple break in. Not worth paying to keep the two of us out when we were already paid to be there.

Sometimes I need to remember that she's not my boss anymore

Nope you dont need to do anything. Just like the other commenter said, go to U2F and then to the website where you wanna log in. When it asks to link a USB key plug in the flipper and click Ok

The SD card I used had some folders and files on it when I set up my flipper. They all remained and were visible by pressing down from the main screen.

I'm betting you can create your own file directory using a pc (or phone if you have one of the few phones with an SD slot).
-------------------------------

You don't have to swap out the key or anything, just use chrome? Sorry I'm a noob at this tbh
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-10
Honestly I'm just trying to get it working, I tried when I first got it too and for some reason I like can't figure it out, was trying to get like discord/git/Gmail etc but apparently my browser doesn't support it? Idk I'll try chrome
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-10
I use the U2F successfully with Google, Gitlab, Duo, etc. Plug in the Flipper when Chrome prompts you and click the USB Security button.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-10
Hey friend. Without giving me too much detail.
What service are you trying to use to create the key?
For example: you trying to get your google account on there?
It works like this:
Go to "whatever sit dot com".
Get to the point where it asks you to register a key, make sure you got the Flipper plugged in.
Go to U2F on the flipper and it should ask you to hit the "OK" button (center button).
Let me know if that works for you. I have multiple services with the Flipper as my backup U2f.

If flipper didn't insure the package there's nothing the USPS will pay.  Maybe $15 but the contents I posts almost 300. After the second flipper and accessories. I've sent 2 complaints about this situation and was told to only communicate with flipper through Kickstarter otherwise they're hands are tied. Flipper isn't responding to my first message on Kickstarter. Tiger only thing that Kickstarter will do is suspend there account since flipper didn't use Kickstarter to take more purchases. They found a loop hole and side stepped Kickstarter. So by taking to the comms manager here.  Kickstarter has no authority. Which note seems like shady business on flippers behalf. I'll report it again and to the better business bureau. I don't , g CVS c I'll get my money or reward back at this point.  Blame keeps being pushed onto another company. Just a Lil empathy from flipper would be nice but they got money to make and don't seem to care about customer service or even justl) abs should've known to good to be true... few hundred dollar lesson don't trust anyone ever. Don't rely l even lever my house.  There are other reasons for the depression) this was just icing on the shit b sandwich I've been eating and letting reddit see my mental breakdown...

I woke to a comms manager yesterday,big mistake should handle all communication through Kickstarter. Ye I've gotten my tracking number and atrra says they delivered to the USPS so it's not their problem. The email I got in tretutn said after may 15 I could try to get an insurance claim. They would need to have insured it. So neither offered any resolut other then not their fault. Terms in Kickstarter say that the creator is responsible for shipping. We risk our money before it's made. Now it's the creator responsible to do dur diligence in getting our rewards to us. I didn't get to choose shipping if so I would've insured anything over 50 and requested a signature. My mistake for contacting them directly. All other communication will be through Kickstarter. I find 2 different outcomes to unacceptable after paying nearly 300 and waiting 2 years
-------------------------------

I've reached a tracking number that said it was delivered. Emailed them and the said I could try to go an insurance claim.  And a comms manager here said they delivered to USPS it's not their problem. While Kickstarter terms states it is the creator responsible to get the reward to me. I never got it. And they aren't responding on Kickstarter the flipper people. I don't remember a choice in shipping I would have requested a signature or at least insured a package that was $300

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I see. I would keep bugging the postal office about it. Dont mention anything about a claim. Just tell them Hey where is my package and get them to admit it was lost. Reach out to kickstarter too and raise a complaint there. One avenue has to work out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Kickstarter faq section says it's the creator responsible for shipping. And if they didn't insure it. There's no way to claim it.

Im genuinely trying to help. Sorry if initially I came off as rude. Another solution would be to call USPS and ask for proof of delivery or a trace on where is went. Again, its most likely a postal service issue rather than an issue with Flipper

Tracking says delivered but according to Kickstarter it's the creator responsibility. I didn't choose USPS. I ordered nearly $300 from them I would have requested a signature on anything above $50 or at least had it insured. I'm going to communicate with them through Kickstarter so I don't get wrong info.

This was always a community centered project, and the community is pretty active on discord and lots of great things in the works.

If you were expecting a James bond hacker device out of the box, this isnt the right product for you.

While I agree that as of right now there isnt a lot you can do (at least for my use case), I have been having a blast with it and learning a lot.  I see a bright future ahead but thats all thanks to the developers and community putting in all the work.

Just be patient and good things will come, or start reading up and developing your own additions.

Sometimes I wonder how many people who do own one know how to use it properly.  I'll admit I don't, but I still have fun with it.  But I also got in on the earlybird pricing lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Lol were both dumb. I was in a hurry and save link as so I got the same thing. 

That saves the web page and not the actual sub file. 

For future reference its best to use git clone or wget to pull files from GitHub, especially if theyre big.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
As mentioned, I'm a complete noob to this stuff. Just trying to figure my way through it, and reading this sub had been really helpful. 

Originally, I downloaded the .sub files and put them on my SD card using the F0 app. Those downloaded files didn't work for me and I had no idea what I did wrong. I put the SD card in a reader on my computer and opened the .sub files with notepad and they were jibberish. So, I copied the 11 lines of code and pasted it in place of what was there. Saved each file and put my card back in the F0. It appears that this solved my problem. No more "cannot parse file" messages. 

I have not yet run across a tesla to try it on, so I'm not absolutely sure I fixed it - I only know that it appears to work and I don't get the error anymore. I'm sure someone will let me know if I'm wrong.

If you have the tracking number, what does it say? And if it hasn't moved in a long time, open a support ticket with USPS to see what they say. If you can confirm it was mailed, then USPS lost it, you will have a much clearer picture of where to escalate.

The radio scanner is the baofeng UV-5R. $25 on Amazon. I love it. 

You could order a programming cable for it as well, I have one, but I haven't played with programming it via the cable yet. 

I just googled my area and manually saved a bunch of channels that I wanted to scan over  

I also have a couple os SDR's shown in the picture and for those I use a program called SDR++

You should just get a wifi deauth. Its like 7$ for the board and you flash it yourself and controlled via your phone. Sure its another little gadget to carry around but it works great. If my flipper and accessories arrive I can look into just using the flipper for it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Im a bit confused because you dont seem to know whether its even been shipped. Did you enter the tracking info to see where its at? If it says theyve picked it up then that means Flipper has delivered your order and post has lost us. If it doesnt say theyve picked it up or its on the way, then you can blame Flipper for not delivering. You can file an insurance claim with post if theyre the issue. Like theres so many possibilities of what happened but you seem confused because you dont seem to have looked up the shipping tracking
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
When did your flipper ship? My black USA shipment is part of wave 3, my backer kit just recently populated with tracking info but usps still hasnt been handed the item by the international shipper.

Eta: may 19th.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
At least your saying there can be one filed previous message I got was maybe. And to me that's just unacceptable.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
You should contact your post office, as (from what I've gathered from your comments) your package was lost by them in shipping

We have delivered your package to the USPS and it's them who've lost it, not us
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Should I get Kickstarter involved? I really don't know what to do and don't feel like I'm going to get any resolution
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
That's the EU batch, it will come after the wave3 US batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
If you already have the tracking number and it was in wave1/2 then it means that it's outside of our responsibility and there's literally nothing we can do except wait and file an insurance claim, as we have no control over USPS.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
And have emailed support that's where I got a maybe on filling inurance claim on may 15. With no other resolution or options. I put money in when there wasn't a flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
What about black flippers shipping to Italy?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I've received a tracking number already. I should already have them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I haven't really had a chance to play around with my flipper since, unfortunately. I was originally planning to order blank cards of the type they recommended to test with on this thread.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I've emailed about it and the only answer I got was wait till may 15 and maybe.. I can claim the mail insurance. I spent like 300 dollars on the first during the Kickstarter and second one after the Kickstarter promo and silicone covers. And it's a disappointing response. Maybe.. I'm just very frustrated
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
The wave3 plane on which your order is located should land in the US today. After about a week or two of customs clearance etc you should receive it. If you can't find your tracking number in your email, you can email support@flipperdevices.com (we are currently a bit overloaded with requests so answers usually take 3-5 business days) and ask for help there.

You can also view shipping updates on https://ship.flipp.dev/

Making it so you can just add the files to your SD card is something they have mentioned they are working on in the discord. How soon it gets implemented depends on a lot of things, I'm sure, but they *are* working on making it easier.

There was recently a big change I will have to do some rework to my FW. Plus apparently plugins are a thing now so custom FW may be un-needed.

Please stop spreading misinformation
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
As of firmware 0.57.0, there is a Snake Game included.   


I could be wrong but from what I've seen so far, the game file has to be packed in the firmware. I don't think it can just be saved to the SD card and launched from the file browser.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I still guess it will be May 27th.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Ah okay thank you
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
This is incorrect. We haven't yet provided any estimates on when it'll be back in stock (as we aren't sure either).

You can leave your email on shop.flipperzero.one to get notified when they're back in stock
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
You could easily write a addon for pwnagotchi to deauth on command by adding a button or 2 or 3 depending on how you want to do it. You could have the button turn deauth on and off, you could add a  menu to let you choose which network you want to deauth, just like with the flipper, pwnagotch is customizable solution.  I would think it would be better to mod the pwnagotchi for this since the flipper would have to have the wifi module attached making it much larger(and would still have to write the scripting to do it).   Or just wait for flipper one to come out that will have wifi built in.

Oh wtf!!! I've been waiting 2 years and the 2in bought never showed up.... I still have to wait a week to make an insurance claim..... This sucks horribly....

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
No, the flipper doesn't have nearly enough cpu power for machine learning
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Maybe you can write some code to 'bind' the Pwnagotchi to the F0 and then remote control it?
Having said that, are you sure this isn't a problem that has already been solved by the Pwnagotchi community? Seems like it would be a common annoyance and easily addressed.

I'm retired and they no longer use Windows at all. It's a money issue nothing more, Windows is not free. I've already installed a linux build so it no longer matters.

I would like to hear from the devs tho as to why the 32bit version isn't supported (or at least made available as unsupported) if all it takes is changing a bat file for it to work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
Is it doable? Absolutely yes! Is it supported as in coded in fw? Very unlikely, I'd bet it's not.

So as long as you edit the code a bit (or repurpose the ESP on the board), I can't see why it wouldn't be possible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-09
I was having the same problem, 

I got it to work in a mac book and on a Linux box np.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
If its using protobufs over BLE, each command needs to be explicitly implemented. The [Main protobuf struct](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-protobuf/blob/0ad90705b9434b6f8fb2c4b605069f0d56d8cc70/flipper.proto#L52) lists the limited set of commands the Flipper firmware understands.

You could add a new command type and implement support for the command in custom firmware. Of course only your firmware would understand the command.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
I try to stay at 99.99995% accuracy. The rest is just my ignorance of something.
Best advice, get on the discord and you WILL learn some new things. Very helpful community.

Flipper zero does not have built in WiFi. You need to get the WiFi module which uses the ESP32-S2 chip. It supports what you want to do, but you will need to implement almost everything yourself.

Anyone have an STL for the flipper case itself?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
Could be integrated with the flipper to provide some support to it/relieve the pins

No such thing as a dumb question, just jerk ways of answering them. Lol

Right now, not too much.
I did see some cool projects like Taking all wifi passwords and emailing them to you. 

In time packet capture. But only capture to review the data on another device, which is fine.

I'm learning myself. Got too many projects in the works.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
Hey I am new to this stuff.

Got my flipper "Ontario Canada". 

What does that extra WI FI board do for you?

Sorry if a stupid question
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
Ooo since you brought that up, it's a bit early, especially given the ongoing chip crisis and how long prototyping takes, but the same Flipper team has plans to make a follow-up device called Flipper One with a Kali OS with the main focii being WiFi and Bluetooth pen testing abilities.

WARNINGS:
- it's still in the discussion phase, it cold be years until it is out given the F0 timeline
- it looks and sounds a lot like a Raspberry Pi 0W, which if you don't know, is a tiny $10 computer, it would be very useful to use this for learning your pen testing and don't need to be afraid of destroying a much more expensive desktop or laptop. With peripherals like a $10 microSD card, and $5 power cable, which are the bare MINIMUM you need to run this, it's a total of ~$25 for a weak Linux computer. You can already install Kali on one. The other peripherals you'll need for pen testing then are the same as with any other system, like buying your own monitor mode WiFi antennas or adding other hardware for NFC. This might be a worthy avenue to explore while you await a Flipper
-------------------------------

May sound dumb question on the surface, but it might retain heat = bad for anything.

Do you have to recompile the entire firmware to make a plugin?

Do you know if you will be able to use Arduino GUI as promised?
-------------------------------

C and working with Embedded Systems, I was able to modify the firmware(its open source) using some existing support docs with Docker.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-08
That is a very solid answer.  There is a wifi module that the flipperzero can interface with using its GPIO pins to broaden the spectrum if the Flipper.  Keep an ear out for the Flipper One.  It will have wifi and be a much more powerful tool.  I agree with you.  Kali OS and some sniffing tools like a pineapple maybe.  It is a useful tool for cybersec IMO because it could be a way through multifactor Auth if the policy is RFID or NFC tags, and it can function as a badUSB.

Scalping is when you buy something at face value, wait for demand to increase the price, then sell at a profit.

Call it whatever you like, its shitty to do with a company / product like this.

Overpaying is fine, but youre not addressing where that payment goes.

Mark my words, there will be two flipper zero communities
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-07
I had a similar problem. Tried different cables and machines. So long as your machine is still registering the device when you plug it in, you should be fine. I ended up building the firmware from source (https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware) and then using qFlipper install from file.

It was definitely a panic moment on if I nuked it before building from source, but it ended up working afterwards. You can revert to whichever release after, but at least the little guy should breath again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-07
Problem is you're either going to have people that are complainers and annoying or people that are going to sing the Praises of this device and not talk about the problems with it and unfortunately those two camps are going to make it so that it's go to be impossible to have an intelligent discussion on it online.

Also am looking into printing my own protector for it.

I'm sure it can handle most problems so it's not like it's strictly needed, but I want to have some space that makes it easier to locate nfc tags where they detect best, as well as protection for any GPIO modules attached.
-------------------------------

I might be telling the truth
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-07
Hang on... mine hung for maybe a minute or so. But the computer (q flipper) display was doing something. 
The flipper unit itself went blank on me which the dev said was normal. 

Did it push eventually? Or you get locked  up?
-------------------------------

Too bad you cant set plugins like snake to the favourite key. Kind of spoils the illusion if you have to scroll past Sub-GHz and 125 kHz RFID on the screen on the way.

What key fobs? The ones with buttons and stuff or the ones you get near the reader to unlock door or whatever?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-07
I'm updating right now and, yeah, it looks frozen (both the app and nothing on the device display, not even the small LED). There's occasionally a choppy animation on the grid pattern in the app. I'll wait... :)

Connect you flipper using a USB cable to your mac

Use `minicom -D /dev/cu.usbmodemflip&lt;device name&gt;` or `screen /dev/cu.usbmodemflip&lt;device name&gt;` to connect

You can press tab to autocomplete your Flipper's name

From there you should see an ASCII drawing of a dolphin. Input the needed commands there.

CLI stands for "Command Line Interface"

Basically a way to access your flipper's features via a terminal

There's a ton of ways to use it, just Google "Connect to USB serial" and find guides for your OS

Also I think we'd have to have an automatic naming convention associated with the captured bursts. That way if multiple captures are initiated, it could save them individually without the user having to do so manually.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-07
You still have to kick off recording in order to capture signal bursts. This would allow the device to be placed in a certain location and initiate recording autonomously without us needing to be present.

I suppose with a 128gb SD supported it could sit there and capture for a long period of time, I haven't tested how long a signal file can be, but you'd then have to manually cleanse the file to emulate the captured segment (assuming you captured a signal during that recording phase).

If anyone might be willing to compile the 32bit version of qflipper and save me finding/installing a bunch of software packages I don't currently own (just to do an initial firmware update that cannot be done wirelessly), I'm sure more than a few people would be grateful including myself. :)

Also, is it possible to upgrade the firmware manually? I.E. drop the necessary files onto an sdcard and install from it? If yes, what files (or extension types) do I need to download?

Thanks again everyone.

I was actually going to ask about Beofang. Especially as part of radio scanning setup.

I've used it in the younger days but since then was told it has horrible frequency spill and there is a lot of places where it wouldn't be allowed.

 I don't think anyone cares in the middle of the forest but I'm curious if I remember details correctly.
-------------------------------

I'm pretty sure the car has to be in park... I've, uhh, done extensive research in this area ;)

One of my neighbors has a model s, and often spends time in the garage, I'm guessing polishing the car or something. Whenever I see the garage light on I take the dog for a walk so I can trigger it.

Is it immature? Totally. But after a shitty day at work the simple pleasure of hearing him yell out WTF makes my day just a little bit better.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Im surprised this is up without the obligatory baofeng hate.  I for one appreciate their price and effective use! 
I gave a few out to friends / family that wanted to have emergency receivers ( modified firmwares limit ability to transmit without a few hoops first). 

Whats the plans with the flipper? Ive been using it as a Swiss army emulation key around here, very interested in what you may be doing with it and connecting to external hardware.

Great explanation!  I've been watching the NFC/MiFare reading/emulating evolve over time and like where it's going.  When I first got the flipper a few months ago, it could read and emulate my NFC but that was about it.  Roll forward a month and a half and it could then extract the secret keys from the card.  Pretty cool!  I was hoping it could use those to emulate the card, but we're not there yet.  I'm sure it's right around the corner though.

I also like the potential for Amiibos emulation, but for certain games data needs written back the card.  It seems the data is getting written, as the Flipper now has the option to revert back to the original data.  Pretty sure this will be figured out at some point too.  I've considered digging into it myself, since you can see what data changes, so maybe it has something to do with the extra keys needed when extracting from the original.  I have some blanks I'm going to use to compare the data and try to figure out what's happening.

1 : 2022-05-06
I was thinking the same, but then I thought the people designing hardware for the next version probably aren't the same as the people building/shipping the current version and the people working on software/firmware. So they could be working on the next version without impeding current work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
They are entirely busy with producing the Flipper zero and getting firmware to support all of the available functions of the hardware. 

If they released info that they were working on the Flipper One, there would be huge public outcry because they're still working on the firmware and production of the Flipper Zero.

They could always just re record raw right then and there, and decide to try to broadcast it on frequencies that you shouldn't legally be able to. But at this point I think you and I are just playing a game of devil's advocate.

 Airport security googles this tamagotchi thing while they've got you in a holding cell, finds this conversation, and realizes that it's not legal to have this device in its current state, confiscates it, and laugh about it as they escort you to your flight. Or jail or whatever, I don't know your country's laws.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
How so??
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I guess in that case I could just delete any RAW saves in any illegal frequencies?  To my knowledge you cant just blast a random frequency unless you enable debugging or have the frequency saved to replay.

Might want to get the original one doing anything more than running a bunch of crappy ducky script first LOL
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I would say take some time. There was a lot of improvement we can see that made it into the zero that similarly should go back into the One.  Among other things it would be great to see proxmark integrated making it a standalone proxmark device. I'm sure that would drive up the cost but given the reasonable price on the zero and its functionality bumping the price for some serious upgrades seems more than reasonable.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Also looking forward to documentation! And I'd love to help if i can
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I am very much a person who learned the difference yesterday, so take this with a heaping bag of salt. Countries have restrictions on what frequencies devices are able to transmit. Just googled and found this helpful table: https://www.data-alliance.net/blog/legal-illegal-frequencies/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I want to send arbitrary commands like the commands sent by the Android app. In the end maybe being able to have independent app with buttons that perform actions on flipper zero. 

One use could be telling flipper zero to play tones on speaker. Or broadcasting IR profile every X seconds. Or whatever user wants.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I'd definitely report that to the forum if you can duplicate that.
Thanks for not mailing me film it. Lol.
Still haven't done anything with the wifi yet, but luckily I have not had one issue upgrading on stock firmware.

I can say the only thing I did different than many = factory reset the flipper the day I got it.
I do it on every device I buy.
Way too many times the stock firmware may not have installed right and QA can't catch everything.
I'd back that sucker up and perform a factory reset on it, but what do I know.
Please report it to the forum so it can be logged by the developers for others.
That's where they want official issues sent.
Good to know of potential issues on that.

Odd.
I always plug it (wifi board) in while it (flipper) is powered on..even did the reset and boot test buttons.
No errors at all.

Doing that now for you.

How would they even know if its modded?  Like what would be the difference to them if they were looking at it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Please allow for a virtual remote to be set up so I can use my phone+flipper for easy IR control. That's one feature I miss most since leaving my galaxy s5 and the 'sure' app. Would make for an awesome universal remote. Also would be nice to somehow allow the arrows to be assigned on the device itself for easier use. 

Also FYI I updated my firmware to the standard release and then the RC release. Now I can connect to the app and have the universal tv database, but in the process I lost my saved Samsung IR remote. Wish that wasn't the case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I dont believe you if you dont have a photo.  Just messing with you dude.  Thanks for the update.  I think its been figured out as something that just happens if you plug it in while the flipper is on.  If you plug it in while its powered off then turn it on it works fine.

aight, still, my post is about the One which id like to get info for.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Per the Flipper shipping info, there are a little over 8700 Flippers that have been successfully received by those that backed/preordered.

There are over 20800 Flippers currently in some phase of shipping. There is an undisclosed amount yet to be processed.

The site still has them listed as sold out.


Not taking shots at the company as they've had production issues due to various world events, but it's a stretch to say they're out and available.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
For real bro.
-------------------------------

I think most of us would disagree with your logic sir.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I'm a regular pre order half way accross the world and got mine 2 days ago. I'd argue that they are out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I wouldn't really call the F0 "out" until the supply situation is normal. 

Right now it's just a handful of backers and preorders that have them.

100%. Would be awesome if the adjustment was possible within device configs but if it had to be adjusted via qflipper and file updates I don't think anyone would complain.

Boom!  That worked.  If you plug it in when its turned off then turn it on it works fine.  If you plug it in when its already on it becomes convinced your Micro SD is empty.

You mean implementing a trigger (and associated adjustment for it) for the capture, that shouldn't be too hard given the graph is already outputting a signal level.

Haven't seen it mentioned here so I thought it bears mentioning: If you've modded your device, flash your DFU back to factory default and make sure you aren't running the modded "unleashed" firmware, juuuust in case someone knows about broadcasting frequencies. 

I echo all of the above sentiments otherwise.

I'll let you know in 7 hours. I'll try it on my flight today
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
There is zero reason they would ever confiscate a flipper, your giving the device *way* too much credit. Flipper isn't going to turn you into an elite master hacker that's wanted at the border lmao 

Long as you don't like have the wifi module or some other stuff connected to the GPIO that makes it look like an explosion device there's no reason they would even look twice at it. 

Just relax....you're good 
-------------------------------

1: "What's that?"
2: "Like a Tomagatchi thing."
1: "Oh cool."


It doesn't even fall under the need to be taken out of your bag. My Arduino board I had at one point got less attention than an original Gameboy I had brought on another trip - bag hand searched, three-minute conversation about how cool and old Gameboys are. TSA's looking for bombs, drugs, and other prohibited items (which F0 is none of) that shouldn't be on a plane - I wouldn't put it past most all of them to not even gather what the various tools are for.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Do they X-ray luggage?  My wife has me paranoid about it getting taken at Customs now lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Ive taken it on flights no problem, theyre looking for very specific things at airport security. This aint it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I personally haven't seen any of those too, but there's really no reason for them to not be let through, we have all the necessary documentation for it and are not breaking any laws whatsoever. 

If you really want to be sure it'll be fine you can turn it off and put it in your luggage
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Do you know of any reports/posts of them *being let through* ?  Specifically out of the country?

I really want to bring it cause it would be fun to play with on vacation just nervous about it being confiscated.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
As of right now we have not heard any reports of TSA not letting flippers through, so you should be good if you're not going to use it there
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
I think the worst that would happen is TSA finds it and won't let you take it. You then get the option to throw it away or mail it to yourself. At least that's what happened to me a few years ago when they found a prohibited item in my carry on. They had special envelopes I could use, but I had to go back to the check-in, it was way overpriced to mail it, and I had to go through the security line again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Is it contraband or illegal?

This is under discussion on the SubGhz forum category on the official Flipper forums:
https://forum.flipperzero.one/t/my-garage-door-opener-seems-to-hop-frequencies/2177/35

It sounds like there's some hesitancy around getting too close to enabling remote cloning, and this may be a feature for third party, unofficial and unsupported community firmware.

Though I might respectfully disagree that new randomized remotes would be an issue, I can get concerns around the potential misuses for this when trying to keep the Flipper certified by the FCC, etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Additionally, it appears that these daily limits are stored in RAM.  If you reboot your Flipper, you can gain more experience in a given category.

I accidentally stumbled across this just by rebooting to try the development builds.  Now that I know this, I'm trying to not reboot unless necessary.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-06
Try powering it off, plugging the board in and powering it back up

Backerkit route? How do you check? Figured tracking would be in email
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
it just needs to support UART mode, which is not always correctly implemented in cheap cards. Beyond that, it can be slow and small. I picked up a pack of 5 32GB micro center branded ones for $20 and they work fine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05

What OS version on the flipper are you?
I got mine 2 weeks ago and had no errors.
I should probably test it post the new firmware.
Are you updated to the newest?

All you have to do is use it :) I level mine up by cloning key cards, using the bad usb, emulating, and using the ir remote. 

I would download a library of ir remotes and mess around Walmart or Best Buy, you'll gain some points lol

I knew I had a crappy old insecure garage door system. It doesn't matter to me. My entire house is insecure. I love having my garage door opener controlled by my flipper. It's my primary use case. It did suck having to wait three years for a replacement garage door opener.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Not able to save them either. Not that saving them would be particularly useful, I suppose.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Well I can scan them, and they show up. But unfortunately I'm not able to manually add one to emulate.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Actually it looks like Security+ v1 support was added to dev 5 hours ago... Uploading to the flipper to test it out now!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
It looks like this is possible for only a small subset of garage door protocols, for instance my opener operates at 315 mhz using the Security+ protocol, and I don't see any way of emulating that.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-05-05
Yeah I did not choose anything special. Still, not the greatest workflow maybe.

I am trying to contribute some badusb scripts, but have yet to actually get started as I'm still discovering features and things.

Hope you get yours soon!
-------------------------------

i modified my firmware so when i play the snake game it gives the dolphin some happiness, too.
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-05-05
Thanks for sharing! 

From storage the dolphin.state file can be exported and edited with the script. You can increase the experience (aka level) and the overall happiness of flipper (how much he is butthurt, like the devs called it). 

The script outputs an update dolphin.state which can be put on the device again! 

Let me know if you have any questions!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
The point values for levels are

* Level 1: 0 XP
* 735 XP
* 2940

Given the seven categories, with 15 points per day each, that's 105 XP per day MAX.  

If you max our your XP everyday, it will take you an even 7 days to get to level 2, and 28 days to reach Level 3.  It's nice that they made the level-ups even multiples of 105. :)

That being said, It is very much about the journey, not the destination.  Go out, do awesome sh!+, and make memories.  The levels will come in due time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
So far it hasn't worked with the ones I have tried (2020 and 2022 models) . My conclusion is they also use rolling codes, and apon further research I was right (unless yours could be older). 

Flipper can't clone rolling codes and if you try you could desync your current clicker. This was confirmed by the CTO of Flipper Zero. (see my other posts about this for more info)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
This means your clicker uses a dynamic protocol, which we don't emulate for legal and technical reasons (using flipper to open your garage will invalidate the original remote due to how this protocol works) 

You can manually create a remote with this protocol on your flipper and link it to your system (consult your garage door manual on how to do so)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
You can find this list in the [/applications/dolphin/helpers/dolphin\_deed.c](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/applications/dolphin/helpers/dolphin_deed.c) of the firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Leveling up is intentionally VERY slow (like, multiple months for one level)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
I've looked through the code, and here's the best I can tell.

You can get no more than 15 xp points per day in each of these categories, with different activities providing different point values:

* Sub-Ghz
   * Try to Read a signal: 1 XP
   * Save a Signal: 3 XP
   * Record Raw: 1 xp
   * Add signal manually: 2 XP
   * Send Saved Signal: 2 XP
   * Frequency Analyzer: 1 XP
* 125Khz
   * Try to Read a signal: 1 XP
   * Read Success: 3 XP
   * Save a signal: 3 XP
   * Emulate Signal: 2 XP
   * Manual Add: 2 XP
* NFC
   * Enter Read Screen: 1 XP
   * Read Success: 3 XP
   * Save NFC: 3 XP
   * Emulate NFC: 2 XP
   * Manual Add NFC: 2 XP
* Infrared
   * Send IR Signal: 1 XP
   * Learn Success: 3 XP
   * Save IR: 3 XP
   * Brute Force IR: 2 XP
* iButton
   * Enter Read Screen: 1 XP
   * Read Success: 3 XP
   * Save iButton: 3 XP
   * Emulate iButton: 2 XP
   * Manual Add: 2 XP
* BadUSB
   * Play Script: 3 XP
* U2F
   * Authorize success: 3 XP
-------------------------------

There is only three levels so it's relatively slow to level Flipper up. With that being said there is a mod that was made for its level and mood.

-------------------------------

Thanks for your reply. Will try it out. 

While on the subject of custom firmware, are you familiar with the custom firmware Unleashed?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Ok thank you, very helpful.

Maybe it's time for me to start relearning linux ;)

dave86 : If I'm feeling brave and have the time I might try; at the very least I'll educate myself on the process.

skotozavr : Unfortunately my Flipper must use the pc method as the current firmware does not support updating via qflipper.

I actually (probably ignorantly) expected that the wifi module would have built-in network connectivity so I wasn't really looking at using a pc at all (perhaps this is a future feature).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
I chose the black one so Im sure that put me on the second or third wave but yeah kind of lame being a backer and not getting it before preorders. 

But again its not like Id be developing apps for it so no need for it before software gets fleshed out a bit more.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
The source for qflipper is available on GitHub at https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper#windows 

You should be able to modify the bat file and set ARCH_BITS to 32 and compile yourself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Oh. We dont plan to have 32bit qFlipper, but there are mobile companions already available and web app that we working on.
Also in theory you can build qFlipper for 32bit windows.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Yes must have muddled version on flipper to work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-05
Hi. Is this code only for EU teslas? I tried it here in the Middle East and it doesnt work. Unless, Im doing something wrong. 

Or do I need to update the firmware to the Muddled version?  Thank you!

Have you played around with having "Flipper" be carved in?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
Dude, you inspired me to start scripting some badusb stuff. the hak5 repo needs some IR tools. That's gonna be really fun to use as a starter project.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
Use muddlebox's firmware located [here](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware). The firmware bin is under releases.  It will unlock the freq's for you, however if it's a rolling code replay attack wont be very effective.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
Easiest is copy them directly to the SD card under the subGhz folder. Otherwise, you can also do it through qFilpper, then click on the paper icon near the top left to browse, go to the same place, and right-click then upload. Don't do it into the assets folder, but in the same directory as the assets folder. Then it will show up as your "saved" items.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
You guys are fast and doing good work. I'm loving the fact that I can back up my amiibos, since I've got a toddler now.

The other stuff is a lot of fun, too. Can't wait to see what people cook up for this sucker.

I'm starting with badusb scripting first. The rubber ducky repo is lacking incident response tools, so I'm excited to maybe help there.

Totally willing to beta test and attempt to break it for you.
I'm really good at breaking things that can't be broken.
It's a super power of mine.

That being said, glad that was normal. 
I haven't had ine issue with updating or using this device since I bought it.

Every single update went smooth. Just don't have a dev environment setup yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04

We've designed device in a way that it's nearly impossible to brick it.

There are stages when we upgrading core2 firmware which require special mode when we can not show progress on device itself.

We are working on new update system that will make whole process easier and more informative. Beta test already started.

I know I'm supposed to report issues on the forum or github.com but I rarely sign into either.
No noticeable bugs but oddly during the flash the flipper screen went out.
The q flipper app showed progress but it hung up and I was close to unplug it from USB and plug it again.
Know better than to unplug during firmware update. Risk brick.

It went smoothly though, just screen went out on device itself.

Don't have many RFID, NFC to test though and not sure what information I can and can't show when I do scan something. I'm always seeing things redacted.

Funny because someone noticed the bad USB lag in a posted video but I thought it was my script.
Will need to flash this and test the speed!
Good job!

as others have said, you need to download the pc app to update it. When I had an SD card inserted in mine it gave me the option to update again and it installed the database. They discontinued the web browser updater.

I should first note that there is a bug in 0.56.1 that is preventing NFC Ntag emulation from working correctly. :/

That being said:

There are two ways.  First, you can scan in your amiibo by going to NFC-&gt; Run Special Action -&gt; Read Mifare Ultral/Ntag, Scan the amiibo, then click more -&gt; Save, give it a name, and save.  


If you have .bin files (from your own Amiibo, right. Right!? ;) ), there is a python script floating around the discord that will convert your bin files to the correct format.  Then you can load them into the NFC folder of your sd card and you'll be good to go.  


From the desktop, you can press down to get to the browser, then right three times to get to the NFC section, and from there browse folders in your NFC folder.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
About the universal Amiibo, how did you go about setting that up?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
Yeah ruined it. Cant wait to start seeing some decent looking mods.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
That's the one that I've seen. Looks terrible.

Good point, should be a fairly simple change now that OP has done all he hard work for us

Would be cool to see a slightly smaller version where you trim the foam corners to fit a smaller design

Correct. I forgot file manager let's you bypass calling the file. Deleting post because it's a really freakin' easy solution I completely overlooked
-------------------------------

Boom. You rock. Sorry I missed that in the FAQs
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
Not that much tho, if you zoom in there is a lot of space leftover.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
You need the empty space at the sides because the foam insert is square but the case has rounded corners, perhaps it could be used for MicroSD storage or something
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-04
You can use the file manager, accessed by pressing Down on desktop

1 : 2022-05-04
Nice one. Some questions/comments

I see there doesn't seem to be space for an oring? I'm guessing this is just decoration basically? If so I would suggest magnets as a lock, will make is snap nicely while keeping sleek design.

It seem like it could be narrower? Is empty space on the sides needed for anything?

At the end of the day its for hackers right? Id love to get some 3d models or published critical dims to facilitate the creation of diy enclosures. Would be a great torture test for fdm or sla parts to be banging around in pockets etc too. 

THAT would be the way to do custom colors/designs in my opinion. But everyones entitled to their own!

I thought about modding the thing, changing out the backlights and replacing the buttons, hel, I still might...but it's not high on my priority list. Seems it would be better to cast or print a new shell then end up with a scratchy paint job imho...maybe some folks just want the tomogotchi part?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-03
No
-------------------------------

Or crop it in cases where possible. Also make sure the brush is 100 opaque

I fucking knew it!  I swore it was model paint but never saw that comment.

Since you're studying in cyber security, I expect you've heard of Wireshark? It's a program to analyze pcaps on WiFi or Ethernet connected networks.

You can think of Flipper as a Wireshark kind of analysis but for older mainly analog radio signals, which is to say many of them are going to be physically based, instead of software assigning to different ports or protocols.

Flipper itself is just a tool though, like Wireshark. You don't become a Hackerman from downloading Wireshark. You won't be breaking into the NSA. You still need to learn how to analyze the resulting pcap file, filter for things of interest, like unsecured protocols like HTTP, then learn how to intercept it, possibly with another program or device, and then program what you want to do once you've intercepted it like serving a fake webpage and harvest credentials. Flipper can gather raw radio signals and it can output the raw dumps or copy without understanding the signal. But you need to figure out how to understand it or do whatever you want with it like copying it to another card.

I think it would be fun to play with and learn, but I think it will likely be considered "older" tech and less useful in your studies. I don't have a formal education in this field, but that was the inkling I got from co-workers. They could hack into any device, but they didn't understand WiFi interference or hardware as much. I think you should check out Kali OS and learn how to use tools from there. You may need to get other devices to complement it like special WiFi antennas but you'll learn as you do them. The OS is free and can be installed on most devices, there's even one for Android phones, but at least to start you don't need much investment or specialized hardware to learn on Kali

Take a look at the flipper firmware from the flipper devs. There are multiple ways of compiling depending on your OS! 

The result of the compilation is the DFU file. You can upload this using the desktop app for flipper! 

To start, try a dry run without any changes, if that works continue with this tutorial. If you make mistakes in the code, the compiler will let you know why and where!

Also, any advice on what coding language to learn for this?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
It is only the cool new pen test tool on the block and incorporates multiple devices into one. The interesting thing is that this little device is underestimated right now. Do not look at what it is right now, but what the potential it has to be. You can wait and play with official build or completely customize this bad boy yourself with custom (mind is the limit really). It is very much ground level which makes it a good project to get involved in. That being said, you need to do what I did which is started to learn to code. Much like anything it is only worth what you are willing to put into it. The community is amazing though. I have seen some really cool forks of the project. In terms of security, this is not exactly things that are covered on Sec+ but then again are. This device has the capability to be one of the coolest pen testing devices in quite a while. Just the Bad USB feature is well worth it. Combine that with the radios.....the WiFi dev bpard, the developer boards as well. I mean seriously the sky is the limit. Even people that made Pi magotchi (sic) have got one of these. It may be a while before you can get one. I paid 170 roughly and could easily sell my device for over 1200$ but will not be doing that. Hope that answers that for you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
It's a little box what has some radio antennae and connector pins. You hopefully have ideas to use some of those things some day in a programmatic way, but hopefully not too soon, because a lot of it isn't working quite yet. You're buying an idea. [The 'Docs' page](https://docs.flipperzero.one/) may give you an idea of what features it has and what's planned, even if half that stuff isn't implemented completely or working well yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
So helpful. I am waiting to the dev to add much of that functionality, which I know will come in time.
I got another SD I am pulling out of my Pi to sue for testing and pulled out my test phones (android and apple) to test one.
Created a whole new gmail to log in for testing.
I am committed, just been busy with another project that is eating my time.
This may have been some of the most helpful info on that though. Did not know about the IR library, I am going to add that over the weekend.

Oh wouldnt that be grand? So tired of checking the site manually just to see the sold out button :(

Well, it's not a firmware file, just a saved file formatted to populate the universal tv remote. For this, it has to be named correctly and put in the right spot on the sd to work. But yes, any saved capture is just a file on the sd card that can be moved and saved elsewhere or to another device. I can send you an .ir capture I made on my device and you just have to drop it into the infared folder on your sd(I think that is the folder now. They changed it from irdb) I can also send you nfc files and you just put them in the nfc folder and they show up like you saved them yourself. 

Currently, flipper only look in the root of these folders, but you can open files in sub folders using the file explorer on the device. Also, plugins currently require a custom firmware to be written to add new ones. So if you want to change the music player to something other than marble machine, you'd have to make a new firmware to change it. 

Another thing is that files will not change functionality outside the firmware. So if someone gave you a subghz file that wants to transmit on a blocked frequency, you would have to have a firmware that allows you to broadcast on that frequency to actually do it even though you can see it.

Yeah, my txt file had no spaces and that's how it copied to Reddit.  I tried to edit it just now and those spaces don't go away.  However, in Windows, it copies to notepad without spaces.  For anyone else....yeah, lose those spaces and keep everything on a new line, with caps, in the right order.  


The DELAY commands are in milliseconds, so on a slower computer you can totally increase those numbers to 2-3000.  Any thanks for mentioning the other options on geektyper!  There are dozens of options and different backgrounds to choose from.

I ordered mine about 18 months ago.  After seeing what it will be able to do.  Just got it last week.  It was a long wait but well worth it.  I too have a nice library of remotes.  Kind  funny picking it up and turning off the tv on someone hahah.  Ill be honest.  I have no idea what I am doing with this device at all.  I got it because it seemed cool.  I see all the posts and the discord discussions and it has made me want to dig in more. I mean someone already made tetris!  I am a programmer by day so I plan on having as much fun with this thing as I can.   The flipper hardware is solid.  The team behind it has been transparent through the entire process. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see my debit cards work and I like the idea I can phase my Yubi out and use this. (Unless I read that part wrong)  I am going to try and clone a care more and my garage door opener.  I cloned my dave and busters play card also.  Going to try the flipper next time I go there!

&amp;#x200B;

Keep up the great work flipper team!!!  This product is going to rock!!!  Give it time.  In another few months there will be more updates and more plugins we will all be able to use!

It was kickstarted, so you're going to get randoms that probably will shit-talk this device for 10 years. I mean that's what has happened on every other kickstarter I was in, absolute nutters mad that they didn't get some magical idea they made up in their heads about what they were going to get.

Lol.
All good 
No judgements here.
Definitely make sure to use the official Discord and join the forum.
The developer like people to post problems there especially.
Check out Dooms work for sure. 
He made an app that tests your plug-ins and allows you to emulate your builds.

I'm just starting out in coding so those tools help.

Also try docker if you plan to build apps
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Thanks for the insight! I joined a couple of Flipper-based discords (including the official one of course) and have been keeping an eye on the forum since mine arrived. Muddle box looked interestingSome research looks to be in my future.

To answer your question honestly, yes. The targets I picked were low-traffic, low-visibility, easily accessible TVs. The only function I was testing was on/off and of the two that did work, I left them as I found themmerely a test. Did I have  express permission? Admittedly, no; but I was particularly deliberate in my risk assessment and made certain my tests would not cause disruption or damage. Outside of this pedestrian attempt of an experiment I have no resources at my disposal (that I know of) to test this otherwise.

Big thanks for this. Gonna update to this as soon as I get home.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Can you do that?
Had no clue.
Can I DL that firmware and just take the IR DB and drag and drop it to the flipper folder?

Can you do the same with the nfc and other sub radios?

That would be.....amazing versus flashing any custom firmware.... unless that matters for those frequencies. 

New to this topic.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Won't even assault you on that comment.  This is all my opinion what follows.

Realistically this project is barely off the ground. 
The focus was getting devices in hands which came with many issues (no fault of the company).
The software library is moving at a rapid pace but in reality IR DB is not as big a focus as RFID or NFC.
IR is not a staple in security testing the other frequencies are.
The community customer firmwares are cranking out by the day.

Check the other repositories if it's a major deal and flash custom firmware.

Muddle box (sic) has actually forked the project and added a boatload of new frequencies that were not originally supported.

That being said, give it time friend. Join the Discord and forum and even contribute your thoughts.

It may spark some great ideas.

I also have one. Not posting what were using them for / sharing our code does not mean that no one is using them for new things.

This kind of post is part of the reason why. If I open source my work and its remotely useful , Ill get 1000x more people asking for feature requests / asking me to fix a bug specific to their use case than I will people contributing to making the project more useful.

Thanks for the great explanation. I had no idea that those features were built in to commercial displaysmakes perfect sense, of course.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Nice line of questioning
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Lots of displays used in large corporations (and probably college campus') are "commercial" models that, among other things, use different IR codes to make it a little bit harder for Bob with his remote to mess with them. 

We use Samsung displays here, and they don't respond as expected with consumer IR remotes. A few buttons work, but not for the right function, etc. 

I was able to get one of the remotes for the Samsungs and I created a new remote on the Flipper, and that works well. 

Also some these commercial displays have the ability to have an ID programmed into the remote, and the TV only responds to that ID. That way if you have a wall of 10 of them you can control them 1 at a time using the proper remote. They're not encrypted or anything, just a couple bits to distinguish one from another. Depending on how anal your AV people are they may be using that as well (or they may just use direct serial commands via wire/wifi). 

All things to consider, but the tl;dr is buddy up to someone and clone a commercial remote.

Thank you sir! You get it!  
I have the feeling so many people who bought this expect some sort of magical hacking device they can push one button and drive away with any Tesla they come across or something...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
I mean people have had it for weeks now including myself. Myself and others have not come up with anything new for it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
FYI: they update this site more frequently than the blog:
[ship.flipp.dev](http://ship.flipp.dev)
Currently they promise a shipping update for the EU this week.
-------------------------------

Its a tool for hackers. In other words, youre expected to modify / extend / replace the code to make it do whatever you want. All of the code is open source and reasonably well documented.

Hacking is about discovery and exploration. Please dont be afraid to tinker with the code. Dont ask what can this device do?, but instead ask what can I MAKE this device do?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Got it installed this morning in Unleashed, nice job!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
They said may 6th 8k US will be done assembling. They started working on that batch 10 days ago. EU is 20k devices of you do the math that would take around 20/25 days to assemble. Then they need to pack them individually and ship them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Was wondering the same.. I think well have to wait an additional month
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
That not what they say in their Discord. Source?

1 : 2022-05-02
At this point I expect to receive it as a "extremely early Christmas gift" 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
What can't it do? IR remote assign multiple buttons, iclass cards, rotating car key fob emulation.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
No EU is not even in assembly yet. At this moment the last US batch is in assembly expected to be finished around may 6th. After that EU assembly will start 20k devices which will take a couple weeks. Then they will all need to be packet which will take a couple weeks. And after all that it will be shipped. So expect around mid to late June when you will receive it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-02
Expect a blog post regarding shipping soon!

STL when you're done. I'd like to make one too.
-------------------------------

Crap, I should fix this. Sorry

1 : 2022-05-01
The wifi module is just a blackmagic probe as far as I can tell so far. The firmware is on github, but it's only super helpful for development thus far.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-01
This was just a test print so i didn't use higher quality settings and orinted it rather hollow but it still feels very solid. The design is pretty popular on thingiverse because of how sturdy it is. I am just resizing it to fit the inserts.

This sub has a 99.999% overlap with r/cyberdeck lmao
-------------------------------

YES!
I got a pelican case for my kindle. Used inserts to stop it from sliding around. Was made for tablet. Such good quality cases. Does the 3D print have that same "tough factor"?
-------------------------------

Now we are talking. This is the kind of development we need.

Please do share!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-01
Printing the lid now to hopefully fit the insert for the cable. Once i clean up the hinges amd work out how to add the label to the top i will share an stl! Does anyone know if there are .stl files of the dolphin or "Flipper" font anywhere?

Unfortunately you have to compile your own firmware to load it right now.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-01
Bro, I was actually a little bit disappointed, because of no support for plugins yet.
-------------------------------

Lol so was your initial comment. Have a pleasant day, dear.

I got the email to confirm my address about 3 weeks ago, no shipping notification yet tho :/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-05-01
Hey I'm still new to this and learning as I go, but how do I actually compile the files into a .dfu to flash the firmware? I followed what was in the guide but with your flappy bird and tetris files instead, but I don't know what to do past that. Also does the enable green UI plugin work? I figured I'd try and followed the same steps for that one too.

Judging by your post I figured unhelpful and unwanted was the name of the game?

Smug because you come in making assumptions and acting like an ass. Just stating a fact that your comment was unhelpful or needed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
Yep, I know various HID cards are being worked on software wise.  I also know the current firmware still has bugs related to the RFID.
I'm looking forward to seeing the full potential of flipper as development continues.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
Stating the fact you havent bothered to check makes me smug? Yet you complain when someones states the obvious?

Whatever you say boss.
-------------------------------

No, we know what you meant.  No need to come into topics trying to act smug and leaving unhelpful comments on people's posts.

The reason you have had no luck, is what I mean.

Way harsh, Ty.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
If you bothered to do any research you would find your answer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
It's being worked on and has been documented in several other posts regarding HID cards
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
Thats because theyre using Google to authenticate for an internal resource. I assume they use G Suite for their internal backend since its cheap, secure, and allows for this type of integration.

Minor detail: you need to have a properly formatted (FAT32 or exFAT) SD card inserted when you run the update in order for it it to install the database.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
Bro!! You need a wee bit more patience. For really, it's a miracle that everyone is holding one of these in their hands despite the impacts of the COVID pandemic and the world on the brink of World War III starting, yes? This went from Kickstarter Idea, to hardware proof of concept, and now to the next phase which is firmware/software development. That is a lengthy, but live and breathing phase now. I don't know about other people, but I am thankful the project has come this far and that the dedication remains as consistent as it always has been. The Mifare classic issue will be resolved, it's a work in progress, and for anyone active in the Discord channel (which I highly recommend) it is a known issue with a resolution in progress. I encourage all owners to join the [Flipper Discord ](https://discord.gg/D5aFzm74Zh) and from there my friend there are specific channels you can raise your questions in and get better feedback. There is also a forum on the flipperzero website.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
c) the code is open source, as is most of the schematics.  Hack it if you are not happy!  contribute to the downstream firmwares that are trying to fix the things you gripe about.  Complaining when you have the ability to help fix it is just annoying
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
b) Anytime you see a version number that starts with zero, like say 0.56.1, it mean it's prerelease.  Or beta, if you prefer.  personally, that's an exciting time, because that means we get cool new features with almost every release.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
a) backing something is an investment.  Investments don't always work out like you hope.  personally, even in it's beta state, this has been a cool tool/toy for me.  your milage might vary, but understand that's the risk.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
I personally just think its a shitty thing to do because Id rather see the company supported.

The same ones begging dont seem to understand that more money to the company will either decrease production time or increase quality.

No, magnets do not interfere with NFC under normal circumstances.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
Yes, you are doing "something wrong".  You are not understanding how NFC access control systems/the flipper work.

The flipper will read and store an NFC card (and a variety of low frequency RFID cards) but depending on the type of card used, and the way the hotel uses those cards, the "emulation" may not be sufficient.  The cards might be simple cards and the lock just reads the UID from the card, in that case the flipper should work as the flipper only emulates the UID.

If however the lock uses some sort of extra data stored on the card then the flipper doesn't (currently) emulate the full card.

Some cards are cryptographically secure, in those cases even much more NFC specific tools (Proxmark3, Chameleon) cannot do anything to emulate those cards.

On the plus side for locks that just use the UID then the flipper does work perfectly.

Yeah I kinda am starting to feel the same, seeing alot of stuff is "still coming" or "deactivated due to principles" or "not a priority"..... really starting to lose faith in what otherwise seemed like an awesome teaching/hacking virtual pet (oh, the pet feature "isn't a priority" either, apparently )

What the hell have they been up to this whole time? Maybe people who use the discord regularly are more keyed in, but RN it's starting to disappoint 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-30
The docs suck. You had two years to put this together and there are barely 800 words in the WHOLE of the docs. 
Get it together and get this ready for the backers who supported you

I'm not a hardware engineer so I can't say for certain but aside from cathode-ray tubes and magnetic hard drives and floppy disks (all of which are obsoleted to some degree in the modern day and none of which are present in the Flipper Zero) I've never had any problem at all with computers and consumer magnets mingling.

I am so new to this so allow me to sound as dumb mode as possible.   
How do you load the assets (amibo dumps) onto the flipper?

As well, how do you get the flipper to run the files? I am trying everything and all i have done so far is create txt files that the flipper cant even recognize.

Ah, so not quite rolljam but a similar idea. That makes sense
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-29
I've played around a fair bit with firmware - so far flashing seems to be rather reliable, so there is a low risk of bricking.  But I get it.    


They are working on the plugin functionality, so just be patient otherwise.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-29
When you get yours may depend on where they're at on the list of backers, as much as your location. I got mine last week (im in the US), and my backer number was in the mid 16,000s. Maybe that will give you an ideas where you're at for fulfillment. Hope that helps a bit.

Currently using it to control all the high end projectors I use for live events. Its a great conversation piece and having one remote to rule them all is super helpful, now I dont have to search for a remote. 

I can also control a perfect cue so if we ever lose the remote my flipper can act as an emergency back up.

* Thanks for the reminder about fan remotes!  I just recorded the signals for mine.
* I tried reading my dog's microchip, but neither the 125 KHz RFID nor NFC readers picked it up.
* I've also recorded the most commonly-used buttons on my TV remote, and [reported a features request to set up multi-signal IR sending](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues/1171).

...But outside having a really expensive TV/Fan remote, there isn't much for me to do with it until side-loading applications is supported.  Right now it looks like the only way to add apps/plugins is to roll your own firmware, and I'm afraid I'd manage to brick it.  (I think there's a brick-proof reset sequence, but I'd rather not need it)

Making bad usbs is my personal favorite so far. However, let me warn you about key fob cloning. 

If you look at my past post about key fob cloning, myself found out it was impossible with rolling codes and the CTO of Flipper said they purposely made Flipper not designed to do such as thing, also it will desync your current fob. 

Older keys don't use rolling codes so you should be fine but I would do research if that's your sole purpose. For TVs there is a growing database for you to download right off the bat :)

I might need a bit of help on the commands, I can find the flipper but can't seem to get it to spit out a log....?? 

Would be really nice if there was a website with all of this information btw so people who boughtthe Flipper to learn this stuff can..... actually learn this stuff.....how's that coming??

I updated its firmware and copied over IR remote files. Im not a wireless(well I understand WiFi cracking, but thats different) hacker but love gadgets. I really would love to dig into it to learn more but starting at zero with a device with minimal documentation does make it hard to use it. Im hoping as more people get them I can read what they are doing to learn how to use it more.

Let's see -   


* Used it a lot as a universal Amiibo for my Animal Crossing cards
* Copied my sub-Ghz remote for the light on my ceiling fan
* Used the sub-Ghz to debug my weather monitor so I can have it imported into Grafana/InfluxDB via rtl\_433 and nodeRed
* Set it up to be used as a backup U2F on a few sites (Yubikey is still my #1 for this)
* Copied the 125khz RFID for my cat's food bowl - just for testing purposes
* saved a few Infrared remotes for use around the house.

Not really all that special, but we were at a computer security conference last weekend and there was a row of 3 Tesla's next to each other. We made them wave at us with their charging ports.. 

Really that's about it. 

I've opened my garage door and car (rolljam), I've read a few 125kHz cards, cloned my door card for work, read a few DS1990s, cloned a commercial display remote so i can troubleshoot things a little better at work.. Nothing too exciting really.

Reddit is not a site for professionals or experts in anything, and the flipperzero is no exception.  *All* subs are dominated by &lt; pic-of-whatever-topic &gt; shitposts like you describe by attention seekers.

They haven't fixed the folders yet but you might want to update the flipper to latest dev build fixing the amiibos issue with some not working because of the flipper NFC bug where switch sends code back to flipper to verify &amp; because the flipper didn't accept write permissions back it kept from allowing some amiibos to be used but it's now fixed

There is a lot more content on the Discord then the Reddit page in my option. However, flipper does have BT and it doesn't seem far off that it's a possibility to do BT sniffing. 

I would float this around the Discord and see if anyone bites. I would like to see where it goes as well :)
-------------------------------

lol telling people they are fucking cro-magnons is not exactly the endorsement for joining discord that you might think it is lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
I guess I'm trying to prevent people from going to the effort of taking up pen and ink to hand write letters to Kickstarter, asking if the Flipper Zero is compatible with the latest MacOS update. They can just join the discord.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
While I agree with most of your points I think we should just encourage better content on Reddit instead of encouraging everyone to go for the discord, when you're new and just looking for something, resources on Reddit are easier to find than a discord
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
I'm not sure what the end game of the post is. Are you posting on Reddit to not bother with Reddit and only use Discord for Flipper? Is your take that nothing of value will ever be found here on Reddit about Flipper? Or are you more upset that there isn't parity with the density of the information available?  


Could at least do the Reddit folks who don't know a solid and throw in the Discord invite.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
The post isn't about self congratulatory egocentrism. The post is Discord &gt; Reddit. People do need to start somewhere, and I feel that the best place to start is where the information is more easily accessible, and the discussions are more active.

I ordered mine in January, felt like a kid waiting for a birthday present

1 : 2022-04-28
I'm on both, and while I get more out of the Discord (got some good information and have been having a ton of fun playing with BadUSB and Power Shell) everyone has to start somewhere.  


I do find Reddit better for search. Discord is great for having tons of information on discussions, but it's a lot to parse through versus just finding a thread that probably has your answer.

Amiibo issue was quite specific and local to nfc. Infrared is something new.
-------------------------------

Looks abnormal. Can you provide `dolphin.state` file from internal storage (you can use qFlipper to get it)?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
Not yet, but we plan to add it in future.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
Flipper have it own logs, you can access to them with cli interface that is available on usb vcp:
- close qFlipper
- open any terminal software that you have
- choose flipper port
- type `log` command
- open your files in Infrared app
- copy log from console

Currently releases are published quite frequently (approx. weekly) but this might change in the future
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
Yes!  Thats exactly what Im running into.  I was pretty sure it was a software issue but it still makes me feel better seeing another user with the same problem.  Hopefully it gets fixed in the next update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
Conflagrations!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
Not sure if this is any comfort, but the longer you wait, the more complete the product will be. For parking for instance, my garage uses AWID (not HID) 125khz cards. The hardware supports it, but the firmware support for most 125khz cards is still being worked on at the moment. Same goes for more NFC functionality and other protocols.
-------------------------------

Consider yourself lucky your address is locked, I'm not even that far!
At this point I'm considering just stealing a dolphin from a zoo
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-28
It depends on the protocol. A lot of them use stuff that flipper doesn't have enough juice to push. I don't remember details.

But I'm sure some if them should work fine. Especially those with cards.
-------------------------------

Question I have for you is, what do you want to wifi board to do? From what I've seen there's nothing stopping you from using the esp32 board you have to hack together a board similar to the wifi dev board. But then why stop there. The world is your oyster with a flipper, a proto board and some code.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I really depends on what you want todo.  Something cheap that you can pick up are some ntag215 nfcs tags. Those are rather cheap and rewriteable with a smart phone.  I wouldn't buy a ton of them and you should shop around as you can find them really cheap. One cool thing is you can use your phone write any number of records to a tag, the write it to your tag and finally clone that new tag into your flipper. Doing it that was able to create contact info tag (email, phone, name) within a few seconds, then get a copy into my flipper. I can now emulate that tag and present it to any phone to give my contact information. 

Ir remote emulation is also rather straight forward. You can download any number of IR dumps then have the flipper emulate any number of remotes. The firmware ships with a huge db of TVs where you sort of 'brute force' all possible 'power' or 'volume' buttons. But if you have one specific one it can be much faster. 

You might want to look at the links here for ideas

I had the same issue and solution. Just had to mash the back button until it unlocked. 
But thats the closest to a hiccup Ive had with it myself. 
Ive already very successfully used the phone app with the flipper in the tv room and kept shutting the tv off on my family from the kitchen, about five meters away. 
I thought it was hilarious.

I gotta admit, its sad to hear that you guys are already gating off features &amp; hobbling your device because it's "against your principle" to trust those who would like to play around with these things. I hate to see gatekeeping or fear of passing on knowledge because of what it \*might\* be used for, because that fear is most often unfounded.......certainly hope that this changes or someone offers an alternative FW without these restrictions, simply to learn &amp; mess around.  


I mean could you imagine the state of the internet/technology these days if all those old school phreakers &amp; hackers didnt just play around with stuff or were unwilling to pass along their knowledge to others who had an interest simply because of their "principle"? It would be non-existent :-/  


I for one am for the free &amp; open transfer of ALL knowledge, especially for tech related subjects, and I had \*hoped\* that Flipper/Flipper Devs shared that sentiment. It was one of the main reasons I was willing to wait out the lengthy delivery &amp; development process &amp; repeated snafus, because the company didnt seem like they would shy away from letting people learn things.......really kinda disappointed to see thats not the case tbh.  


I can only hope this will change (or be overruled by custom FW) with time :(

I was originally just trying to clone my key as a back up in case something f'd up. I cloned a button somehow (the lock buttton) in an attempt to clone the fob and that's when I noticed it no longer worked. 
It will still start the car, but lock/unlock/trunk open/ alarm functionality all gone. 
Ps. I'm not even upset, how cool is this thing!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
When generating a new key from the add manually menu, will we be able to get buttons in the future similar to the IR app?

What would sending the signal from the manually add key do?  I dont see a way to specify lock, unlock, etc.

See, thats the thing, though, if some of the tech is outdated and no longer viable, some of the stuff gets left in on purpose and is entirely legal in that vehicle only. My 2006 CVPI had everything but the siren and laptop. 

Considering its just the key fob, though, I dont think theyd mess with anything like that.

I was thinking about that, you'd need to extract/know the rolling code algorithm used, then in the future you could probably make a plugin for the flipper or make custom firmware that supports it.

Now I just got an idea to install the flipper in a P.K.E meter prop. Kind of a big case but why hell not. XD
-------------------------------

When I use the Frequency Analyzer there is a good chance that it'll show 299.999 - 300.001 and flicker around that frequency. It only seems to happen if I've been testing other sub Ghz devices recently.

Like you, I just reboot the Flipper and it'll reset itself.

I was able to replicate it just now. If I have recently used Read, or Read RAW, and then use the Frequency Analyzer it will often times bug out. I've just gotten in the habit of rebooting the Flipper when I'm going to play with Sub-G

Screen Shot:[https://imgur.com/a/EjpFBg0](https://imgur.com/a/EjpFBg0)

I'm not sure it's actually picking up anything since it's always the same frequency, and rebooting fixes it every time.

iOS. I just tried it again and was able to unlock it this time. No crash. Just pressed the back button a whole bunch of times and it finally unlocked. 

I think it could work a little better to unlock but not unworkable.
-------------------------------

On a Ford to resync your fob use the other one to unlock (you should have been provided with two) and then use the deactivated fob within several seconds. The car should start accepting it again.

Ive always wanted to know how new key fobs for cars are programmed. I was under the impression that the only way to get those fobs is locked by the manufacturer but if all I need to do is a song and dance, Id love to have my flipper my my key fob for my car
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Did it crash?
Can you replicate that?
I had no controls enabled when I did that.
I'm moving all my flipper stuff to a test phone so I can truly play with the features.
Going to enable 2 profiles so I can test the play store versus the apk.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I couldnt unlock my flipper using the screen streaming because it wouldnt allow me to hit the back button fast enough.

Currently the latest information is firmware update 57 should fix this bug &amp; as updates further get released the flipper will see more improvements
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Thanks!
Another comment explained in a lot of detail. 
Thought it would be nice to have as one device to rule them all.
Even to capture and look at the packets later on another device would be amazing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
So above my pay grade. 
I'm still learning base Linux, Python, and go commands.

Thought it would be possible but knew it would require some adaption. 

Should have posted this..... will post this in the Discord because I know people like a challenge.

Thanks for confirming this!

If you are up to doing some "car hacking", you might give "forscan" a look. It's a factory level OBD diagnostics software, that allows you to do all kinds of programming on Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Not only can you read info/codes for check engine light, airbag, etc, you can add features or turn them off as well. (You can also add keys and fobs!)

You'll need an adapter to go from USB to OBD2 connector, and a Windows PC. The "elm" style adapters are usually under $40, just get one with the high speed/low speed switch.

Just be sure to read up on what you want to do, as if you go changing stuff with no regard, you can break your car. There are quite a few videos o how to do common tasks with it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
In theory its possible. You will need different radio stack and application to show packets.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Frequency analyzer can only pick repeating signal. Some fobs dont repeat payload, so analyzer unable to detect frequency
-------------------------------

Firmware version? Logs?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
We know. Fix scheduled for next release. We also included amiibo/Nintendo tests into release testing procedures.

Ah, okay! Thanks for the quick response. Loving the subreddit and the flipper zero. I'm really happy with the success you folks are having. Well deserved. Best wishes!

We are working on fix. Will arrive with next release.

Oh ok cool.....honestly I didnt know if it was worth all that, just was hoping to be able to jump from page to page in the IR key page with the up/down buttons that dont do anything atm.....I guess I'll take a look at the git, ty

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I think there's an esp based module that works with the Bluetooth stack that someone has written firmware for vulnerability scanning. You could then port that to work over UART and write your own plugin to control it on the flipper. The flipper itself does not support 2.4ghz.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Even though we don't have DUMB mode yet, you could always show the cartoon idle screen and then pop over to snake. Maybe someone will port tetris!
-------------------------------

Just walk out of range of the car and click a button a bunch of times. Should cycle the keys a bunch.

I dunno that's so minor I don't know if it would matter much to me on a device like this. Unless it's really annoying.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Kinda random, but certain NFC (amiibo - yeah, I know...) features that were working on the previous firmware won't work now on this update. When I revert back to the previous firmware it begins to work again, but won't on the newest. I was just wondering if anyone knows what that's about and how to potentially correct it.

Would have been better to buy a cheap fob at Wal-Mart to clone your FOB back to.
The good news here: it works on key FOBS....wow.

This little device was worth the money.
I originally bought it to clone FOBS for people who lost or had broken ones.
Read it didn't work, but this is proof it can.
Sorry for your loss there.
Hopefully you can get that fixed.
-------------------------------

Ah ok, is there a source on that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
What kind of vehicle?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Yes, as I was saying it's an **upcoming** feature, meaning not yet availible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Well, I think kinda the point is this makes every flipper unique in a small way
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Thanks for the reply! Also, sounds good I think everyone would rather have more features over the mode when it comes down to it. Just got curious so I figured I would ask. :)
-------------------------------

That's caused by a non-uniform backlight layer, please send us an email at support@flipperdevices.com and we'll see how we can help you with this

The dumb mode is not being developed right now as we're focused in more useful features (such as Mifare Classic emulation) and spending our dev resources on the dumb mode would slow down everything else

It'll be added eventually, but not in the near future
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I made a post about this a couple of days ago and the CTO said that it's one of the risks. I also did some heavy investigating into rolling code hacking/ car key cloning and it's doable but the amount of work/ risk is not worth it as you also found out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Meaning the generated remote should have separate buttons for lock,unlock, panic, etc.?

Cause as of right now, if I manually add from the sunglasses menu, I only have the option to send a signal if that makes sense
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
If everything's fails call a locksmith that has the required equipment to reprogram you car's computer.

Some car use rolling codes to make sure no one will be able to sniff your signal. A car locksmith will be able to fix it

FWIW, I'm _way_ out of practice (soldered a bit in a class in high school, but not since), but I checked YouTube for some "how to solder" videos and I'm feeling much more ready to give it a try.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Look up how to program the car keyfob for your car's make and year. You'll probably have to do some stupid dance like turning the key and winding the windows up and down, but you'll have a functional fob in the end.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
My understanding is the codes some key fobs sent are only good for 1 use, to prevent them from being cloned with things like the flipper, you must have used the one time from your flipper, now your key fob is out of sync with the car.
-------------------------------

My last update was on April 6 saying it was prepping in HK, so I'm assuming my Flipper is in Canada now, woohoo!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Any word yet when pre-orders for next batch might open?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I think this is still just an upcomping feature, but the point is the flipper should be able to "generate" a new virtual remote. You'd add / pair it with your car - however is it done in your car (idk, never done that) as if you'd bought a new / spare car remote. Except instead of remote, you'll use flipper and generated virtual remote instead of buying one.  


So you end up with 2 remotes paired with your car. One pysical that you already had, and the other, on the flipper that shoud teoretically work in the exact same way as if you'd just had 2 pysical ones...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
What do you mean by add a new one?  Are any of the manually add option viable to use as a car remote?  How would you use lock/unlock on it since it doesnt give you buttons like in the IR app?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Forgive me. Im used to more volatile parts of Reddit and just read this in the wrong tone. Thats on me. 

Generally, yes, the Home Screen is called the desktop to the best of my knowledge.

weirdly aggressive ? lol it wasn't
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
It wasn't meant to be aggressive. I was genuinely trying to clarify naming of the UI. 

Like everyone else I too am new to the Flipper. Is that screen generally known as the Desktop?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Looks like a defect behind the display between the polarising and diffuser films that disperse the light evenly on the display. 

Depending how the displays are assembled, you may be able to fix it by lifting the glass LCD layer off the films and cleaning them, but you stand a high chance of making it worse
-------------------------------

Iclass is not implemented

Totally correct! Thank you

Solved. I just needed to update again, haha. 
To answer your weirdly aggressive question though, the desktop is the neutral screen with the dolphin on it, so says the documentation.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
Which screen are you calling the "desktop" screen?

The screen that has the dolphin on it is the one you want to hit right on.

0.56.1 is the current firmware. I got mine Saturday and I believe I updated the firmware for the second time Monday. Found the comment here about the update. I have the passport functionality you seek with that new update.

1 : 2022-04-27
Update it again, there's been a new release since then

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-27
I updated it the night I got it is it not the latest stable release?
Happy to run an update again not exactly a high stress procedure. 
Im certainly not complaining, the team did an incredible job and the whole thing is a pleasure to use and play with. And easy to boot.

1 : 2022-04-26
Until I receive my device, Im stuck doing a visual look over for now, and, comparing it to other persons photos.

So far, it looks like its going to get there, but, its current organization kinda bothers me. The Home Screen, to me, doesnt need to show any device information outside of am I connected and the devices current battery percentage, along with some navigational tabs, like, how the ARCHIVE tab is set up. I would also suggest moving the device information in to SETTINGS, kind of like how Apple has it set up when you go under Settings &gt; General &gt; About.

The play alert could be cleverly hidden somehow, maybe like tapping on the flipper device picture on top of the screen to trigger the sound to start and stop?

Other than that, I cant say much else, since Im still waiting for it to come.

They're a variant of the EM4305 series.  I don't think those can be rewritten, but it's entirely possible to print your own crystals and put in a rewritable EM4305 inside the printed version. I've got two like that, that I've used a proxmark to write the code to.  I haven't edited or tried writing addresses with the Flippper yet, but the data is out there and easy to sort out.

Make a pwnagotchi, they love to sniff for wifi signals naturally and alert you when they find one. If there is a WiFi camera, the pwnagotchi will also try to crack it automatically, a useless feature but funny none the less.

If it does take off really hard, at least they have the subreddit ready to go. Nothing wrong with prep, I guess

Then I would think it could be how the display thinks the image should look. In that case maybe an update might fix it or seeing if the past version before this happened fixes this as it looks like a software issue and no longer hardware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-26
Turn down the backlight. Might help remedy with a temporary fix.

Could be dust. I already have some under my screen.

Mine has a similar event at the top; so long as the backlight is coming through I don't see it. But if I angle the screen away from me almost a few degrees from flat, I see the clear plastic is malformed and refracting a lot of light.

This is a great idea. Care to share a diagram or just a clearer picture of the board. I think I may put together a dev board similar to your design. An LED just to show the pin being active and a screw terminal for connecting things to. Did you have any other ideas for useful things to put on there that you didn't include? What was the reason you wanted to be able to disable the LEDs? Sorry for all the questions. Thanks for sharing.

Security cameras use IR LEDs not UV LEDs. Also late model iPhones filter out IR light. While it doesn't work perfectly it significantly reduces how much IR is seen.
-------------------------------

Yeah, known problem. Maybe we should add an icon to Flipper Zero's status bar that will appears when serial port is opened.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-26
Nice! Thank you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-26
one thing you can do immediately is use your phone's camera to search the room for cameras which utilize UV LEDs for lighting at night. when they're cheap enough, they will often leave those LEDs on even during the day, which makes them fairly recognizable on your phone's camera as a bright dot.

Those files are likely still there but on the internal storage.  Seems once the SD is installed and setup it only reads from there for those saved things.  I had the same thing happen to me and was able to use the file browser in qFlipper to download what I wanted from internal storage and upload it to the SD and then it all showed up.
-------------------------------

You could probably paint it pretty nicely with some model airplane varnish, Ive used it on model kits and it does a good job of practically staining the plastic the color so its not something that can easily chip off vs mode enamel paint. 
And I took apart my flipper the other day when I accidentally got some sand in it when I had it in my pocket at a volleyball court. So it seems like itd be pretty easy to take apart the main components and spray it down with the varnish.

Hidden cameras are entirely separate from hidden wireless networks and require a different set of skills to detect, that I do not have, and about which I cannot comment.

&gt; I also see these sweepers that apparently work well (on Amazon) for like, $500.

On Android there's a free app that scans for WiFi networks including "hidden" ones called WiFi Scanner. On Linux (maybe also the BSDs?) use the Aircrack-ng - I found an article on-line that claims to explain it: https://linuxconfig.org/discover-hidden-wifi-ssids-with-aircrack-ng. 

&gt; could we cobble together a scan feature that's low enough power that it's legal

Signal reception doesn't use power; you're receiving power that's already there. It's somewhat like hearing, where you're just detecting energy that's in the air. You don't use energy to hear or to receive signals (your phone or radio need power to *understand* what they're receiving) and you're definitely not gonna break any laws by trying to scan for WiFi signals.

&gt; using the suite of sensors on the flipper

WiFi exists only in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz ranges, which are not covered by the Flipper Zero's internal antennae.

The flipper doesn't natively have Wi-Fi, but with the add-on module, maybe.

I'd expect a Raspberry Pi Zero W or Zero W 2 might be a cheaper choice if you're buying something explicitly for this task.

I attached LEDs to each of the GPIO pins for dev and testing. Each will light in sequence, corresponding to the pins selected via the GPIO demo software. All the LEDs can be disconnected via a jumper and then the GPIO line can be attached to any device via the pins on the board. It's a fun little thing. I can't wait to start working with the serial communication pins and attach different devices.

This is a google spreadsheet of pretty much all the available information on the kyber crystals.  It's got information and instructions on which addresses and which values are responsible for doing what. There's a mountain of information there, but it's written to be as easy to get through as possible.  I wouldn't be surprised if flipper is added on the page for rfid hardware in the future.   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13P_GE6tNYpGvoVUTEQvA3SQzMqpZ-SoiWaTNoJoTV9Q/edit?usp=sharing

the cheap garage ones don't use rolling code and thus don't need syncing. they just use the same code all the time. this is why you can just record and play back the rf signal for those and it will work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
Awesome, thanks!
-------------------------------

It took a lot of trial and error. You first need to figure out the frequency of your transmitter. There aren't that many so I just kept trying different frequencies with different options. I tried using the multi-frequency scan tool. I tried using the frequency analyzer. I tried researching the frequency for my garage system. After finding the correct parameters you have to ensure the correct timing of the process. I typed in the codes for my opener, waited to press the enter button. Then I started the Flipper capture tool and pressed the enter button while it was looking for a signal. Stop the Flipper capture process as soon as you capture the signal. Some garage doors have complex security mechanisms in place. The Flipper won't be able replay those correctly.

They've really only just been getting out to people this last month. I wouldn't be surprised if it took a few months for them to get caught up on shipments, and get a new batch up and ready.   
I wouldn't mind having a second one.

From what I gather it is something that is being worked on, but there isn't a time frame for when compatibility will be implemented.

I hope they make more of these. I'd love to get my hands on one.

This works better than I though it would. Pulled out the P-Touch Cube and had it feed some 12mm blank tape through.  Might not be a bad place to keep a cheat sheet if I need to remember something about the device.

Thanks again for the suggestion!

Agreed. There is no guarantee of replacement from a third party seller as it's considered a private sale. The best bet is to ride it out until they open up their website for orders again, I know it socks but it will be worth it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
This hurts to see
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
In practice you just hold the button on the garage door opener near the receiver on the car. That 'programs' the onboard remote.  The cheap garage remotes don't have a receiver. How would they know a code has been 'used'.  Further they work even after replacing a battery. So they have none of the normal synchronization points like a common notion of time. They also don't use a pre shared secret as to connect a new remote you simply put the door in 'pairing' mode and push the button on said new remote (assuming you aren't cloning it).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
Can you open issue on GitHub ?

I would recommend against it. Not only are you paying almost double, you might have a hard time if you have problems with it. I've been seeing a bunch of posts about people receiving defective models. If you get a defective model, depending on how nice the seller is, you might just end up with a dead/defective model and -300$ in your wallet. About the waiting time, there is no "usual" wait time as the product hasn't been sold outside of kickstarter yet (unless there was some pre-orders I missed). My guess is that pre-ordering will become available again once most or all of the kickstarter orders have been fulfilled. If you have the patience to wait, I'd just wait it out, just to be safe.

I was one of the lucky souls who got it last month.  The thing to remember is the firmware is still in early development.  think beta or alpha.  So they are still working on it, and I do expect more features for your dolphin friend.

On another note, definitely join the flipper discord.  it's my go-to resource ATM as the docs are also in development.

Are you envisioning someone eventually being able to spoof this? Trying to see where the harm is
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
from the video it sounds like it is syncing the prng seed for rolling code and requires access to the garage door opener itself. for rolling codes you cannot clone a signal, because each time the signal contains different code, based on the random number generator, and once used, that code (and all previous codes in rng chain) is invalidated
-------------------------------

Is this something that will be supported eventually?

Ouch. Doesn't look like display cable to me. You need new display assembly. Try contacting flipper team for RMA or display part number. Display will cost, but RMA will take a lot of time...

Not a bad idea. I have a bunch of p-touch labels that I'm not using.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-25
This isn't my favorite solution but I used a blank p-touch label to seal over my SD card slot and will likely do similar with the GPIO pins as I doubt I'll ever carry the WiFi module with me. 

It peels off really easily with no residue and in the silicone jacket you can't even see it's there. 

They even come in white and black, how convenient!

Ok, I just tried this again. My TV remote shows up as Raw in the iOS app.

When I try to teach the Flipper a new button, it seems to stop reading the moment it gets one entire button-press, and the only options are Retry/Send/Save. I dont see a way to build up a sequence of button-presses with the UI in the stable firmware.

I'm still waiting for my flip, so I haven't looked into modded firmwares yet.

A debruijn sequence is used for the brute force attack of outdated garage doors and gates.
It is a sequence of all possible code options in one long string and it works if a system uses a shift bit register. It's all explained in the video above.

I don't understand why people think a rolling code isn't clone able. I have two cars with embedded garage door remotes. My garage door opener uses a rolling code. I was able to clone one working door opener into both cars. Clearly they are doing a replay attack and its working.  I'm actually hoping clone the garage door opener a third time with the flipper zero. I would also like to see a brute force attack at some point.

Sorry, but I got other things to focus on than to follow a blog of a project that has several setbacks. All I asked is to have myself filled in to why things are not moving on - I got the answer: chip shortage. The project is very interesting, but if you live in the real world and got shit to do you can't be up to date to every single thing and all I wanted is a summary since the site, which is the main thing people come to when they want info, is not updated.

So EXCUSE my ignorance. Get a life.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
How do I add this
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
They have blogged a lot about the process of bringing this product to market. It was a rough idea when the Kickstarter was setup. 

The wait is due to having to design everything from scratch, test, revise, fine tune and work on mass production, all during a pandemic and associated chip shortage. 

If you are an early backer you may still be waiting for a device (I am). If you missed out you can get on the waiting list for the next round release, later in the year. 

Open your eyes, a lot of progress reports are public on the blog.

That is correct.

Your best bet is to add a flipper as a new remote to the car. Soon, the fw should have ability to create "new virtual rolling code remotes" precisely for such use case.

Tldr; do NOT hack your car remote - add a new one instead!

I haven't seen the nfc successfully emulate anything yet. I have a feeling it is not completely ready

&gt; black magic setup

what is that?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
Ugg. So frustrating.  I have my dev board but no Flipper. I was Sooooo early in ordering too.  Should never have picked black. I STILL don't have my final email.

The pain.

Summer. If everything will be alright.

Hi, you can update it from recovery mode (pressing left + back for 2 seconds, then releasing back). It will remove pin code lock.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
Two more things:

- Can you provide dolphin.state file for analysis. It can be downloaded from internal storage with qFlipper.
- You also can reset progress by removing this file and then restarting flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
Next one will still be for the US. I assume, based on the timeframes for wave 1 and 2, that they will ship wave 3 in a few days/next week, and then start to work on Wave 4 (eu /Uk) and ship it at mid may. This all assumes they wont change their production rate.

cars typically use rolling codes i believe. you will not be able to get it to work by just cloning it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
Congrats! I would recommend checking out the qFlipper gui application, the mobile application and this awesome repo of goodies to start. https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero
Getting on the official discord has been a huge help for finding documentation and fun stuff to do.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
What exactly is my argument? Youre defending the CTO making an asshole response to completely valid criticism
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
Very nice. Im patiently waiting for mine here in NL (EU)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
I actually attempted to install the source code. I'm a failure. 
Couldn't figure out how to get docker on the VM.

If your wondering about car fob rolling codes, Steve Mould did a youtube video about it.  Keep in mind the CTO of Flipper mentioned here the risk of desynchronizing your legitimate remote in cloning it.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24
It's extremely cute. Whoever did the art for this thing did a fantastic job. 

It's actual application in real life, pretty limited, so far badusb works, but that's of extremely limited application, the bank card stuff doesn't work, the NFC key stuff doenst work, I probbaly never will use GPIO, and turning off TVs isn't exactly the height of umm.. hacking the planet. lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-24

I had to put a SD card in mine.  After a restart it recognized.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Ykno I just realized that this is even MORE embarrassing of an answer considering this *exact* same question was asked &amp; answered *in depth* in another post on this subreddit...... several people have asked it, actually 

Just help people learn if they wanna learn something 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
I was about to ask something similar but you nailed it better. I ended up gleefully smiling, cause this is why I never throw "broken" away.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
I've got a similar issue, but on windows. Gonna try on mint next when I have time. Windows won't see it as a DFU device, despite reinstalling the drivers. According to the log, the issue appears to be initializing winusb, whatever that means. I'm not as familiar w/ Windoze, so idk why I started here lol. 

Let us know what the fix is, though?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
That's where I am at.

I was able to access the GUI from the default blackmagic AP, but I think I entered my credentials wrong or didn't complete the setup when changing to STA mode.  I no longer can find the blackmagic AP or find it in my network by looking at the connections on my router GUI.  Dont know if there is a recovery for the wifi module or if that is what I need.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
So jealous that I didn't learn of this beautiful creation until yesterday.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
The responses here are ridiculous. 

This device is literally meant for pen testing and such. It's in the tagline. Why are people immediately assuming illegal activities?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Maybe he's looking to do pen testing somewhere that has a garage bro. Maybe he has permission. This is a stupid comment based on the inherent use cases of this device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Where did you receive your shipping info? My order address was locked about a week ago but I have yet to get anything else
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
As far as I know, the color data is stored in the hex data of the device, so you should be able to change the color by changing the hex data  


Or what are you trying to do exactly?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Ugh, ya think if I check it a third time today it'll be here????
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
You have nothing to show that this person doesn't work as a repo man or have a legitimate reason for wanting to learn. Moralizing isn't needed. For all you know he could own several apartment complexes and lost his clickers, or a million other perfectly legal reasons. 

Gatekeeping knowledge like that isn't cool
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Ikr? How do you think learn this shit? Osmosis?? Point him in the proper direction or say nothing. Imagine what the internet would be today if all those phreakers &amp; old school hackers didn't play around with stuff. Nonexistent. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
I agree.  Just figured it will take a bit of time as the experts get spun up.  You can't register amiibos to Smash either, as when it writes, the data is getting messed up somewhere.  There is now an option to roll back to the original data on the flipper, which is cool.  Now we can see what data is changed and try to figure out what's going with the data.

Welcome to the club!

First thing to understand is that the firmware is basically in beta at version 0.55.2.  So there are a lot of things that aren't working, like plugins.

That doesn't mean your stuck! You can fork and develop your own firmware to add the functionality.  There are several people doing this on Discord!  Hope you will join us!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
This inspired me to check on mine... And they were in the mailbox!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23

Same here! Mine just arrived and after the two year pandemic fiasco I completely forgot to start doing preliminary research/learning since Im new to the world of hacking
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Did you run setup_rules.sh script from the qFlipper repo?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
Got the same thing today! Enjoy!

Just played with that including remote control of the flipper. 
Worked very well.
No way to clear out the deleted folder on the archive tab though.
I really don't want to see my old tags.

The page should reload after submitting

I wish I had a black one tbh, this looks awesome 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
How do you know if this worked or not? No emails sent saying thanks for subing and after you prove you aren't a robot it just goes back to the page with the email field and sub button..no confirmation.

Whats ETH 
and BTC got to do with the flippers?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
That is great news!!  I had the same email 06APR and it didnt move until this Monday 18 APR. I just received mine Thursday so you just need to be patient. Make sure to check the tracking number and it will probably be a few weeks. GL and join the discord for other updated info.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
It doesn't auto lock. Go to the main page with your Flipper hanging out and press "up" on the direction pad. From there select "Lock with Pin" it should then lock with your pin. 

From my experience I haven't had it lock with the pin without doing this.

Surely better than having ordered a black flipper from Europe. They haven't yet build it I think lol.

If you want to level up and keep him happy you have to read, save, write or emulate something (or same thing) every day.

1 : 2022-04-23
No exact dates yet, but you can leave your email at shop.flipperzero.one to get notified
-------------------------------

Yeah its still scheduled for pickup so hasn't left hk yet
-------------------------------

Is it possible to disable this? I really don't want a stupid dolphin nagging me if I don't scan enough

Check the tracking no underneath. Mine hasn't moved in 3 weeks

We can all see your argument is invalid. You just seemed to have trouble seeing it yourself, so I figured I'd give you a hint for the future. :)

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
i think so, then i got in contact with Flipper who advised they had a delay and the labels were printed early or something like that which caused the issue with the emails being sent out early hence us getting an alert. But they are preserving and will get them out soon
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-23
well. this is very disappointing. I am an very early backer from EU. wtf

If you locked it with pin, hit the center button and enter your pin. The back button doesn't do anything if your device is locked with pin.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
That sounds great!

what raw mode? I dont see anything like that under Infrared, just:

- Universal Library
- Learn New Remote
- Saved Remotes

Not do I see a raw mode under my saved remote. 

Firmware v0.55.1

Currently the firmware is having issues reading folders in NFC so that's the work around &amp; also will be fixed by the devs soon enough the flipper firmware is just getting started growing every day &amp; patches being released
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
yeah I can definitely find them that way :) Thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Ya, I'm not the CTO talking down to consumers moron
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
You have to view it through flipper browser ( down arrow then right arrow till you reach NFC tab)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
So they work fine, I appreciate it so much! On mine though, it's a bit weird - I can find the folder and emulate an amiibo from it, but if I go to the NFC application directly or look at it in the android app, it says I have no keys of this type saved. Is it like that for you as well?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Off topic just bought a 2016 tc 6 speed and I love it. Previous car was a hummer h3 and sure it could take a beating but it just wasn't fun to drive

There are 2 main components that need to be finialized before release 1.0.0: FuriCore and FuriHal. First is OS abstraction layer and second Hardware abstraction layer. They are main APIs that needed to develop applications for flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
When have you received your Flipper? I ordered mine a while ago, but have never received it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Thanks for reply, I'll do that. Just to be clear, you're finalizing a high level hardware API?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
My man, do you think he was referring to the literal graphic as personality or how the device was marketed as being a tomagatchi and responding to use and activity? Pretty sure the fucking art team wasnt responsible for the priority of the interactive OS. Maybe try sounding less salty and condescending, first time I see this thing do anything other than scan an amiibo, I might consider recommending it to people.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I can leave mine for days and it never changes, I'm also still at Level 1 so Im starting to think there is an issue.

Yes the harmony remote uses both IR and RF. Your speakers use IR I would assume. If it has a remote, the harmony system can control it and has a preset in the app for this specific speaker Im sure.

Thanks for your help, I still can't read it. It is a Key Fob made by ioProx. Am I doing something incorrectly? I have tried:

Oooo that's a good question. The raspberry pi SoC (pi w) can handle it so I assume the flipper can. Someone feel free to correct me tho.

Good questions. I figured I'd snatch one up before the cool stuff is released ;)  Wonder if the flipper can run bettercap. :D

I got my flip today and I was wondering the same. 2016 tC here with a fob so if you find out lemme know!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Ok awesome! Enjoy!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Same! must be a big batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I'm waiting to see what can be done before I buy one. I'm so interested in the imitations. What I hope can be setup is some type of pwnagotchi situation where you run a script and the name of the wifi or even the handshakes can be downloaded for export. I'm so curious!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Got mine today too :)  I know there's a lack in documentation, what have you done with yours?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Please keep us updated on any pentest scripts you're writing or testing. I have a pwnagotchi which is a lot of fun but I'd love to poke around in my home networks  with the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I've gotten 3 "confirm your address" emails from them since February but not much else. 

I'm so antsy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
OP-1! 

Have you looked into the logitech harmony remote? I'm not saying that you need to get one of those, but their knowledgebase is enormous and their compatibilities are wide. Good place to work backwards from.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
What kind of broken is it?

If you can make it emit codes, even if that involves tape, glue, or even taking the remote apart and using jumpers to simulate button presses, you should be able to record that on the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I have the (broken) remote around here somewhere.  They are very specialized speakers and I would love nothing more than to have control of them with a remote. 

I tried the scanning TV function but no dice. 

Any ideas would be appreciated!

Just download my folder &amp; drop into NFC @ https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/u95yn2/flipperamiibo_enjoy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
How do you add these?  Do you need the physical nfc of can you use the data of it somehow?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Still waiting on mine to arrive. It'd be great to know what is missing from it!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I got a pre tracking email a month or so ago, and have been watching it in the shop app. Good Mail day today!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Just received mine a minute ago!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
YTMND!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Its looking like mine is rolling as I cloned the frequency in raw and it didnt work. Ill check the manual and some information online on my car and try adding it manually. Thanks again!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
It depends on type of key. Static keys can be cloned easily. Dynamic/Rolling keys can not. For that purpose you can generate new key in "add manually" menu and then link it with your car according to service instruction for car.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
What are the features did you think it used and which features do you need? Be specific
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Which features didn't get implemented, just interested?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Yes please was is Blackmagic
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Clicking around doesn't count as an action

You can scan the same stuff unlimited amount of times tho
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Yep, ahora la pregunta es cuando podr ir de nuevo a USA para importarlo 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Frankly, I wish the devs had focused less on giving this thing a "personality" and more on implementing the core features I bought it for and still don't exist...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
My man! Thank you!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I click around. I ran out of stuff to scan.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
yup, no change for me here.

Seems like Australia got shipped before Canada.

&gt;  The AU part of the Wave2 batch lands in Australia today. Look for a nice surprise on your tracking page next week.  22 Apr 00:47
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
mine came in just now. i plugged it in and a red light came on, but other than that ... i'm lost until smarter folks than me start posting stuff to do with it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Thanks for the reply and for such an amazing device first of all. Second, will there be any documentation about creating new unique remotes? 

So far I have only seen people talking about cloning using the raw reader. (I lost my keys and it cost me $400 and Im trying to make a copy for myself). Thank you again!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Heck yeah you lucky dog!

I guess I need to just keep an eye on my mailbox. No tracking info but who knows I guess.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
That part took a couple weeks. Not sure exactly how many, but 2-3.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
What exactly do you do daily? Only certain actions count as activity
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
And my black flipper is still stuck in shipping limbo.  How long did it take to your backer kit to go from the address being locked to the flipper shipping?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Nice, the black is sick! Mine arrived too. I'm in Michigan - Ann Arbor area.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
NICE! I wish I had gotten the black instead.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Sorry, what is black magic? I haven't gotten mine yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I agree as well, I wish they had have offered a black silicone case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
There were user requests for that, but it was never part of the project.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Thanks! This is exciting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I didnt know what you were talking about until I zoomed in. Thats just some dirt from my hands. I was excited to open it. The case was in perfect condition when I got it. The dirt in the picture wiped off.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I agree. But the black looks prettier by itself imo
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Wow black looks amazing imo
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Ah alright. Thanks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
FYI garages have cameras for this specific reason.

happy cake day and thanks for a really cool product (= i've been happily hacking away at the firmware since i got mine. i added a feature so playing snake makes the dolphin happier (1 pt to play, 3 pts if you get a decent score) i appreciate your codebase, i'm learning a whole lot. you've made it easy to build (the docker build image is so nice) Anyway, thank you again and have a nice day!

I recieved my black flipper zeroes yesterday as well, Im in Maryland and ordered during the kickstarter.

1 : 2022-04-22
The documentation page for the Blackmagic board is already in progress and should be up in a few days!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
As for rolling codes we intentionally not including option to clone them. There are couple reasons for that:

- Using cloned remote will desynchronise old one
- It's not intended to be cloned, instead you should add new remote (flipper can create new unique remote and we planning to add more supported protocols in future in future)
- In general it against our principle

But, we left ability to analyze such remotes. And report if they uses known keys.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
It's quite difficult to brick flipper.

Please use hardware dfu keycombo and then reflash it with qFlipper: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/KeyCombo.md

If problem persist, let us known on discord(you can tag Aleksandr Kutuzov or Anna) or send email to support.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Hi,

As for plugins and external apps its currently work in progress.

Our current roadmap: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/RoadMap.md

Also you already can start developing application, just grab firmware sources and check application folder: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Lucky you!

Any chance I can get a link/DM of this directory? Just got my flipper in today :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
while you may just be meaning well, it is incredibly suspicious asking for remote access to someone's computer, as that's one of the easiest methods to compromise their computer, especially when you don't already know them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
I kinda wish I got black now.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Is there anything that uses the wifi module currently? I've ordered on "just in case" it's used for pwnagotchi type things

Found [this](https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroSub-GHz), if that's what you're talking about.

What exactly are de brujins? It says a little bit about it on the repo but I'm still kinda confused.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-22
Correct! Only kickstarter special

Pretty sure they said black was kickstarter only. Someone will correct me if Im wrong.

I have a 2016 Scion iA. I wouldn't consider it "new" but it's not old; However, I don't think it would have rolling codes as I thought about that too, but it's always a possibility.

I was able to Raw Read, save and replay my 3rd Gen dodge Rams lock and unlock signals successfully. 

Newer vehicles use rolling codes and aren't susceptible to this same kind of attack.

1 : 2022-04-21
that's the one i originally ordered. and then changed to white for some unknown reason a few weeks before the deadline. so i got mine already. but i'm going to have to order the black one anyway because i loves me some samhain! :) /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Yeah, mine was with raw capture as well. I looked up the FCC-ID but couldn't find if it was AM or FM anywhere som hoping someone would know.

 I'm going to probably check he discord if I can't figure it out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
I tried to clone a car key but couldn't figure it out, even with raw capture. Hopefully someone has had better luck.

Would you mind sharing  photo of the display on?

1 : 2022-04-21
I got my "Looks like Flipper Zero  Tamagochi for Hackers is about to ship your rewards soon!" email back on the 10th. Hopefully, that means ill be getting tracking info soon.

Lucky  
-------------------------------

Any day now mine should be arriving.
Would be nice to have something to protect the border of it.
Even a silicone thin sleeve around the edges.
Does it fit sturdy, have you tested any kind of capture?

This sub is just gonna be tracking posts for a bit... hahaha.   
In related news, I also have the update.

Seconded, my screen looks identical to yours. I can't stand the antici.....

Grats! Where in the world are you?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
I got an original email from "Flipper Devices Inc"; noreply@trackmyshipment.co

You can enter your Canada Post tracking number into this site, it will search all Carriers, and should come up with an entry for "EasyShip" which is what I believe they are using to get it from Hong Kong to Canada; https://parcelsapp.com/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
I'm going to guess that my Flipper is sitting somewhere near yours in a box. Where did you get this status update page though? All I have is the CanPost which is waiting for an update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
USA East Coast backer, no shipping info for me yet. 

Last email contact was 4/11 just telling me to confirm my address if it's changed. I've gotten the same email probably 6 times over the year.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Update - just checked the trackmyshipment link; looks like the packages have left Hong Kong on their way to Canada
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Yea I got that notification too from Sendle that they were unable to pick it up. Is the pickup location as Laverton in VIC?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Actually, the US portion of wave 2 is only half the total of that wave.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Considering that the packing of wave 2 took more than a week I think mid may is more likely for eu/uk
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
My package from batch 2 is expected to be delivered today in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
USA here, arrived after about a month from getting the email.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
I fully understand how you mean
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
The wait continues, hopefully that comes quickly
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
In discord staff said more likely to be early to mid may.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
My roomie got that notification but not me, weird! 

Its been so long I was just glad to see the address finally locked in.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
I'm waiting like an orphan on father's day.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Me too! Brisbane here. I contacted Sendle and they said they tried to pickup but it wasnt ready yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-21
Me too! 

I imagine they are just going through the backlog.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Came here to see if others were having the same experience. Can confirm mine has been sitting as prepared for shipping since the 7th of April. I'll continue to be patient and wait for it to hit South Aus.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Yes. I forget. I'll try to remember to update you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Did you ever get this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
This is a regular occurrence on ebay. Full of non payers. I sell a bunch of stuff every month and this is just part of ebay's "customer first" mentality.
-------------------------------

Mine is doing the same but I'm in Australia
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Why would you crosspost this here, when the point of that flippersales sub is so we don't have to see all this scalping bullshit in this sub?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Mine used to say April 12 delivery. It still does, but it used to too. 

I check every day and nothing in my mailbox. Looks like canpost is just waiting for them all to land. 

I've a feeling we will all be excited at the same time again. 
See you soon :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Im in Calgary. I have the message with the same date 04-06.
The shipper has created a label for your package and has sent us the electronic information. If no other tracking detail is showing, we have not yet received the package in our system.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
I'm in the same boat. Got the e-mail on the 6th and aside from having a Canpar tracking number there's been nothing since.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Mine is showing April 26 as the delivery date, but tracking has shown up in the last couple days. First it was shown with a USPS shipping partner, and now it says it just departed a USPS facility in my state. Hopefully Ill get it this week.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
They sent me a trackmyshipment link that says May 11th delivery.

That site then links to Canada Post with tracking number that says it would be here yesterday, even though it hasn't been received by Canada Post.

So yeah, as usual I have no idea.  It doesn't really bother me though, since it's been over two years now, what's another few days or weeks or months.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Same situation, except mine just showed up in the USPS system yesterday. 

They sent the tracking numbers when it shipped from Hong Kong, so there was a long wait before any action. 

It looks like I'll have it tomorrow or Friday.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
I think we are waiting for the shipment from Hong Kong to come to Canada, and then it will be handed off to Canpar/Canada Post and our provided labels will get updated once that hand off is completed
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
Doesn't help much but I am the exact same situation - got the April 6th notification and nothing since then. I'm in Toronto. 

Might be for all of Canada.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-20
The *delivered* count is going up!    **4546** at last check.

-------------------------------

Sure is. 600 shipped within US

I actually got mine a couple of months ago, I said this literally the day before I got my shipping email lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-19
No. If you have a flipper sell, it to someone who will use it properly. If not, get lost.

It's not it stock rn? Like at all isn't there even any queue?

I wasn't on Kickstarter, but I pre-ordered when I had the chance.

The only downsides are that: 

1. I couldn't pick black. White only.
2. I ordered the ESP addon board and later discovered that such orders (that aren't just like "one white flipper zero pls") will take loooooooonger 


So now I just sit and wait - the good thing I look forward to - the firmware will be much more developed 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-19
Yeah Im desperately waiting for it to come back in stock like a lot of other people but theres no way I would pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the thing lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-19
Was looking just yesterday at eBay... It's the same story as with anything with silicon inside - overpriced AF while it's still rare...

Luckily I've already bought mine some time ago so now we just wait...

It's original firmware. The only one. All other derivatives.

&gt; ...could one hypothetically get into any gated parking garage with the flipper zero?

No.

&gt; ...could one hypothetically get into *a* gated parking garage with the flipper zero?

Possibly.

Describing how to commit unlawful acts such as trespassing is a bad idea on Reddit. Go elsewhere.

Nah, I'm a pre order, but I think mine is in this batch, because my tracking says april 26 is estimated date of delivery and today is 18th. So it's definitely not only a Kickstarter orders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Wireless or cable?
-------------------------------

Right

In that case there are plenty of available readers that will fit your development. In fact they may be a better fit.

&gt;    USA / rest (Mid April)
&gt;    EU and UK / 20k (Late April)

550
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
I can pay on eBay if someone wants to put it up. Or I can use offer up to pay also.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Not sure how you can cancel a PayPal payment with goods and services? Im not paying cashapp so I can get scammed

I'm just seeing scam. Ship it today! It goes out; cancels payment. Burn, baby burn!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Agree, pwnagotchi isnt a replacement, but its a fun toy that will entertain the aspiring pen tester to build while they wait for flipper to produce the next batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Cool, Thanks for weighing in.

Looks like it's probably a felony to actually do this, but at least some lights, like the ones in my area, are infrared based so depending on the strength of the signal required it might be possible with an unmodified flipper. You'd probably have to be too close to the traffic signal for it to be really useful though.

I actually got a shipping notice! Though it says "expected delivery April 12" and uh.... its a bit passed that now. I assume it'll arrive soon enough. (I'm in Canada)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
I was asking u/totekuh if they were promised a delivery date (two mouths ago).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
From some other comments and posts around here, it seems many people who order/pre-order are getting theirs before Kickstarter backers anyways. OP will probably get theirs before we do.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Thank you. Still just annoying that I "ordered" mine over a year ago and people who didn't even back the Kickstarter get theirs in like 4 months. I understand there are many factors and moving parts to manufacturing and shipping that are beyond anyone's control, but still is just really annoying to hear.

I think its totally appropriate to start a different subreddit dealing with sales. 

I think its also appropriate for anyone wanting to sell their flipper. Financial and personal situations change but charging $500 is really gross. Charging a little more than the original price is fine in my book. Taking the time to understand the value and then wait for the time to get one has its only value. $300+? Of course not.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Dm me I got one for 5
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
It depends on which system the traffic lights operate with. You might find emergency control features in some of them that makes use of RF or IR (OptiCom uses IR). Theoretically, if they use a IR transponder or an RF under 1GHz you might be able to research and interact with a flipper zero (some use 5.8ghz as an infrastructure backbone, youd need an SDR such as the hackrf to research those).

Disclaimer: reverse engineering a critical system might be punishable by law. If it is for educational/academic purposes, you might try to contact the system protocol owners and show your interest on understanding their systems and asking for permission to reverse engineer those.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Well I just created it lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
I have some bad news for you.

I'm a kickstarter backer and I'm still waiting for mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Yeap
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
Probably with some effort and additional hardware in gpio, but don't. The penalties for that dirty of thing are not something to Mrs around with.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-18
No.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Address is locked in at least lol

Have a good one man. May you get a flipper for less than 500!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Oh man!! Thats wild dude! Over a year, I really I hope you end up getting yours soon, definitely deserve it more than me
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I am one of those people my dude. Over a year! 

For 550 you could get some impressive tools if thats your end goal.  

More power to you, I couldnt justify the flipper for that price. 

I enquired with the flipper team if they would endorse a dedicated community for the sake of it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Youre totally right! Definitely dont NEED it, but I would pay 550, its definitely the best on the market for the device. I did put my email down too :) hoping they restock, but with shipping demands being way off on dates, Id much rather pay a hefty price to get my hands on it. Heck, some people have waited a full year for their delivery
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
All of those threads have been downvoted like crazy man. 

Judging by the other threads you will get one but may have to pay a bit more. Saw one go for $550 the other day 

Why not just put your email down? I doubt you NEED it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I mean Im not a rich kid whos whining but I feel the sentiment
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
With no community in place currently,  I hope you understand theres lots of people I see selling them on here as well, or at least asking prices I figured Id just dip my toes and see if someone was interested, regardless much love tho. 

Yeah I feel that about scalping the supply/demand is out of whack with lack of production/delivery which will definitely drive the price up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
It hasnt my guy, its just very easy for a subreddit to be filled with buy/sell instead of about the product / topic. 

It is fairly common practice to separate sales and general stuff. /r/homelab and /r/homelabsales for example. 

No animosity here.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Offering $500 for a Flipper Apple-ifies the brand and drives up prices for everyone else. What good is a cool toy if the community is filled with rich kids who whine when they need to dip into code?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I understand what youre saying, but it why would it bother you?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Ive had mine for months now and still havent really used it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Because there has been ALOT of these. Im just saying why dont you make a subreddit for that purpose.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Why would you want to ban this? Some people are trying to sell theirs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Can we ban these? 

/r/flippersales might be a good OP.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Ill buy it for 500$ if youre interested
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Yep, same.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Is it like the rest of them saying "Picked Up by Shipping Partner, USPS Awaiting Item" ? My guess is this is the order that's coming in?

Mine still expects a delivery on or around the 26th.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
You can always just bash it and see if anything works, but that will take a long time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
So long story short, they're technically sold out/unavailable to the "general public". They were available for pre-order a few months ago (still might be) and they were obtainable through kickstarter. The rest of the United States is supposed to get theirs soon. Your current choices are: pay an absurd price on ebay/whatever, or just wait it out until they become available to the general public.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Pwnagotchi has some features, but I don't think there's any replacement that has as many features as this has
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
2months ago? Get some perspective man. 

There are many who kickstarted it who are still waiting. Ive been waiting years at this point, Im not sour, I knew it would take ages and that was before covid and the war. 

You preordered. If your not happy get a refund and go away.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
good luck with that, they are going 3x retail on ebay, just wait for next batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
to tide you over, pwnagotchi
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I bought mine in May of '21. It is literally in transit right now. All of the blog posts explain the delays and production issues and such, I'm not surprised that a low quantity boutique product is taking such a long time. Especially since the chip shortage made them redesign the board.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I think its probably more like 3-6 months for next batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I have a tracking number for a black Flipper in the US.

1 : 2022-04-17
Leave your email on https://shop.flipperzero.one to get notified of the next batch
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Yep. A black one with a Wifi board and 2 protoboards.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
ALL these orders are kickstarter backers.  I was super early, but don't have mine. Did you order a black one?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I still havent gotten a shipping email and I was a kickstarter backer :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Sure you do buddy, your lack of posts and absence of knowledge of the product make you very reputable.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
You ordered yours in November and got it already? I backed the Kickstarter and still haven't even gotten mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
White one with SD card. How much are you looking to spend?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
You can either pay the 1000$ scalpers want or wait 12 years for the company to make another batch. Unfortunately that's the only ways rn
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
I bought the Kickstarter and have mine.

Were you promised a delivery date?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Patience... it took months for me to get mine, but it did eventually arrive. I got on the order list back in November, and it only arrived about three weeks ago. Marvelous little device!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Maybe less. 

The black flipper is limited edition
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
2500$ for a black flipper with a case
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
It's not publicly available.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
Im afraid you cant really get yourself a Flipper, since the seller doesnt ship Flippers after selling them. I paid for my Flipper two mouths ago, but havent gotten it by now, unfortunately.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-17
This video is a great introduction to garage/gate hacking:
https://youtu.be/CNodxp9Jy4A

The toy in the vid uses the same radio chip the flip does.
I'm hoping over time someone will develop a de bruijn plug-in for the flipper, which would be able to open most outdated single code systems.

Dear new reddit user: thank you for joining us! I hope you realize that the sentiment shared by this community is that we don't support scalping here. Maybe try to save some face, and remove your post. Or join the other scalper posts that have been downvoted to obscurity. 

If you are reading this and thinking of buying, wait. Support the indie developers, not the middleman. Flipper says to stay tuned for live sales, and they have a email list on their website to notify you of upcoming future sales. 

Let's keep supporting the small amazing team who literally slept in the factory in china to make sure we get our $169 USD toys.

Hey Paul, just don't buy it then. You don't even know me and you're trashing me on the internet. That speaks volumes about your character.

Happy Flipping

No you didn't. Even if you did, it speaks volumes about your character. Because the only person who would pay that much is someone with such cognitive disabilities that you'd be taking advantage of them.

Try a pawn shop. It seems more your speed / desperation level.

Wow, meth really must be skyrocketing in price or something, because you have to be tweaked out of your mind to think someone would pay double for it. And only a cracky methhead would try to sell it like this. That or some NFTbro bullshit is going on.

The USB reliability test isnt exactly realistic.   Theres gotta be more slop in the mechanism to emulate a real person fucking the USB port with the cable

Flipper pre orders too  i got mine with the white flipper backers in the US
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
Yeah that means it's a 37-bit card format called H10304.  The 26-bit H10301 format that Flipper understands only goes up to 65535 for the badge number.  

Unfortunately 37-bit HID cards are the most common format in the US so it's kind of a bummer.  

Hopefully they'll work on expanding the Flipper's ability to decode more kinds of badges in the future, especially H10304 since that's what pretty much all of corporate America's office buildings use.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
Its 230344

Its whats printed in the top rh of the card and yes its HiD
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
It's probably a 125kHz card, and it's probably not using an encoding that the Flipper understands.

Is it a HID badge?  Is the ID number printed on the back that starts with '2203...' larger than 65535?  If yes to both, then it's definitely not a format the Flipper can read.

Flipper only reads really basic old fashioned 26-bit cards at the moment.  If you want to actually work with Weigand cards like this you should get a Proxmark tool instead.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
The first batch seems that only included almost 5k flippers. Cant wait for the EUs batch. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
This looks like the same total as I when I visited it about a week and a half ago... is that to be expected? Just concerning to see it stay at 44XX for that long, it'll take a long time to get through the rest at that rate...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
have you tried using both the NFC and RFID scanning apps on the flipper, did either of them produce an output 

if no then it may simply be that the type of card you have is not currently supported under the flipper firmware. future functionality is in the works but for the time being your card isn't supported

if you're desperate about cloning you can look into things like the promxark3
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
So this may out me as an idiot, but its worth a shot. The RFID reader is on the right side, and I was covering it with my hand, and therefore could not read RFIDs until I realized my mistake.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
No, just a nice ass kicking from the pit boss in the back room
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
Have you checked the numbers to make sure the class of the card? The frequency?
Any error messages displaying on the Flipper?
I'm new to all this but after reading comments, I always check to see the frequency of the card.
Example: HID or similar manufacturer.
-------------------------------

Yep, mine still says waiting to be picked up so I think it says that for everyone right now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
that is capitalism. supply and demand regulate the price.  
there is no reason to be angry if you don't want to pay the price. neither is there any reason to be angry if someone wants to pay the price.

How much you willing to pay? My highest offer is 550 . Located in USA
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-15
Was yours coming from Vic? Mine was never picked up. Maybe hadn't been packed yet into individual boxes.
-------------------------------

1 : 2022-04-14
How much you want to pay? I heard they go for a lot lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
According to my tracking it said on the 7th it was "scheduled for pickup" and that it would arrive between 2-7 days. It's been 8 days.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
Yes my black shipped. Seems to be on the slow boat
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
Oh wow! How were you able to get one? These been sold out for a while now 
-------------------------------

This! ^

Im in the same boat friend.

1 : 2022-04-14
I don't think the *AU/CA/US (wave2)* batch is finished being individually packaged yet....  unless they processed AU before CA.

The first batch of 4500 orders had arrived at the Hong Kong warehouse on February 17th, but the plane only arrived in Chicago 2 weeks later on March 4th.   Since wave2 arrived at the warehouse on April 5th, and it's about double the quantity of wave1, they probably won't finish individual packaging for at another week.

Once they are all labelled, I expect the *trackmyshipment.co* link will change from *Awaiting Dispatch by Warehouse* and the local courier, Canada Post in my case, will start updating and delivery will occur within a day or two, since the shipment is *expedited*.

Ive had that for other packages. It means that another company has the package and will deliver it to a destination and then will be properly delivered by the company.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
This scheduled pickup date is not accurate, so theres nothing to worry about regarding any issues with your package.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
Same here! 
My guess is its still enroute to this facility. Then once it gets there, the shipping will begin to their cozy new homes. Cant wait!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-14
Unrelated to this, but something is happening with the shipments logistics, my package today still says:

Your item was picked up by a shipping partner at 12:06 pm on April 6, 2022 in SMYRNA, TN 37167. This does not indicate receipt by the USPS or the actual mailing date.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-13
I was going to ask the same thing.  Why can't the flipper allow write backs to it for NFC storage; i.e., two way communication?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-12
If I had a nickel for every time I checked the tracking page, I could buy 10 more Flippers!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-12
I will sell one on Ebay, send me a PM and we can talk about it.

Bro, how long did it get you to get yours to Canada? My tracking is still saying that the carrier is waiting for pickup
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-11
I just received another one too. On discord I was told the remaining US Black Flippers would be in this weeks shipments, hopefully that's the case and we'll finally receive our locked and shipped email!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-11
Same here. Sounds like that we wont wait to much longer. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-11
Yep - same situation here. Nothing to do but keep waiting but good to know I'm not alone.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-11
Gotcha ... thanks for the reply!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-11
The Flipper could not read the SD card. I cannot remember the exact error, but it "felt" like the SD card might have been bad. I took it out and stuck in my computer, and it worked fine. I put it back in the Flipper and it still wouldn't read it. I tried formatting it, benchmarking it, etc, noting. This happened after i installed update 0.53, so I thought there may have been a bug you would fix in the next iteration, so I just waited. Sorry if I couldn't be of more help.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
Are you using Unix newlines?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
Interesting. 

I got an email the 6th just asking me if I wanted to change my delivery address. No tracking info for me yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
I'm glad yours is coming soon. I ordered black.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
White Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
Interesting, I'm also in Canada, but I have a *Canada Post* tracking number, not *Canpar*.

Also, the whole batch has not yet left the warehouse -- my guess is they'll be released Monday or Teusday once the entire batch is ready.   Then we'll see more details appear on the carrier tracking.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-10
I got a shipping  email recently. It looks like they use some mass shipping  place so delivery  estimates 20+ days. I got a tracking  number April 6 and delivery  about April 26

Sure - if security catch any sort of idea that you're trying to mess with the systems at the airport (whether their assumptions are correct or not) prepare to be treated like a terrorist. Doesn't matter to them that you weren't breaking the law - they will need to ascertain this for themselves. And if they are having a bad day (or just power tripping) you are going to have a miserable time.

Yes, flipper only supports displaying the UID of NFC-B tags for now, so you'll need to customize the fw to read more data
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-08
Thanks for that. I can read my passport. All I see is "NFC-B" and UID that changes. According to u/sirkazuo, we would need an app to decode the data using the printed key.
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-08
But its just my tamagotchi ._.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-08
It's possible with the flipper hardware but the software isn't written to decode the data yet.  Your data is encrypted with a key that's printed on the passport itself, so you'd have to have an app that scans the RFID and then asks you to type in the key from the little barcode on the bottom of the page that has the decryption key.  Makes it kind of pointless to have RFID in the passport tbh except as an extra layer of counterfeit prevention.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-08
dicking around with anything, even passively, at the airport is Not A Good Idea.

If you want to be probed and charged with terrorism then go right ahead and use it in the airport, the least that will happen is you are going to be on the no fly list.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Well before ,t he old way using external hardware and a laptop used to be such a chore. The flipper would actually make it enjoyable again. So treating it like a game I would be more inclined to hunt for devices again.
-------------------------------

Not much of a consolation but You might get it earlier than us then :) in the next couple of weeks l think
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
It looks on RPC (Remote procedure call) protocol version, not a firmware version. So it will work on your custom firmware if it has correct RCP version.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Does the app look at version number, or just if it accepts the commands the app is sending? 

Ie If we customize the firmware based on the most current and use a different fw version ID, would it still work since its the same code even with the different version Id?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
same here got my confirmation and i live on the west side of texas

In this case its just shitty to not support the company pouring their efforts into making a great product.

Then for someone to try to profit off that is extra scummy.

Im curious about this too.
I feel like I use mine a LOT, and hes like a quarter of the way to 2.

Is it based on button presses, usage, or just checking in on him often?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
I know in the discord people hacked their flipper to level 3 and made it so you can change the moods!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Man, someone was angry and/or jealous enough to downvote you for being happy about this. Man, people suck ass
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
No, it's the same app.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Gotcha, thanks.

Gotcha, thanks.

Are you in Europe? I'm a European backer and apparently we are considered less important than whoever backordered in the us, since they are serving those first
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Is it different than this one? https://github.com/flipperdevices/Flipper-Android-App/releases
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Tuga?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Same! 1 white, 1 black, 1 dev board. Kickstarter backer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
No email for me. Ordered black. fwiw my backer number is in the low 3000 range.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
The nostalgia of anticipation, what a beautiful thing. Hopefully they pick up their act and get their shipping in order.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Yeah, If you are willing to pay those prices do yourself a favor - buy a proxmark and play around with it until the flipper is available for retail prices again
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Good for for :) I will have to wait for my black flipper in Europe
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
dozens of us
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Wooo congrats! Just got the confirmation a bit ago?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Yes that would be a dream
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Not really. Early Bird special.  My intent was to let folks know that all components are now shipping. Hopefully, the creators can get cracking on the firmware soon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-07
Big spender, your contribution is greatly appreciated
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Yay got my email too. Also Australia
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Got a tracking number today.  One black and two white flippers with silicone cases for all and a wifi devboard.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Well I had previously gotten nonehe same email February 19th. Its disappointing, but so are all the delays. Reminds me of the delay associated with collecting prizes for toys on cereal boxes as a kid.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
That's the first step, it means they are preparing your countries next shipment
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Kickstarter backer with a black one on order. No email yet. I did get an email early this morning giving me a chance to change my address though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Yeah 99.9% of people think its a kids toy at first glance
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
No email. Black, with dev board. Kickstarter number in the 20k range as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
The screen streaming feature is really cool
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
As of right now  no  but considering all you need is a normal usb c  usb drive  to inject payload    once you have got it in safe mode
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I take it yours is a white one then? My friend is also post-kickstarter and is getting his, while I haven't received confirmation of my address locking. Just that I had gotten an email about double checking my mailing address one last time. So not sure if my black flipper will be in this batch or not anymore.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Recieved tracking info, (Australia) let's see when it actually rocks up.

2 years running my fellow backers!! Or is it 3 years.. I forget.

Never waited so long for a birthday present haha
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Just got my email as well. White flipper with silicone case, my order number was \~20k for reference.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I got this email today as well, black case, dev board etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Today I received like the umpteenth "confirm your address" email so hopefully we're getting close?

I ordered a black-un to the east coast so we'll see. Hopefully by two weeks from now I'll finally have one.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
What case? WiFi board?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Congrats! 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I backed on kickstarter at just over $1,000,000
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I just received my email. US delivery. I placed a reservation after the kickstarter.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
you might get lucky if you hangout with flipper online
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
report back asap  lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
dozens in the fb group reported the same. and a half-dozen of us are getting the wifi boards. /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
USA here, nothing yet for my Black Flipper 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I got mine as well, but its not as nice looking :(. Doesn't even matter, still super excited!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
just checked my email after seeing there, i have that one too woooo.
-------------------------------

Just got another address confirmation email today. Good sign 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
The Orange+white shipped first I believe. Im not sure all the color combos but my friend got bud Orange/white weeks ago and most of the pics we see on here are if that same model
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Mine is about to lock the address
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Europe was scheduled for late April. Based on timelines for AU, we were supposed to receive ours late March and will start arriving within the next week

So, at a guess I would say early May. Maybe. Who knows :)

-------------------------------

Patiently waiting for shipping details on my Flipper Zero. Already had the alpha app installed on my phone.

And there's a tracking number inside!   

FYI, I'm in Canada.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
So Im looking for a flipper post market because Im having trouble finding one wtp above market price. Also if it has some useful tidbits preloaded I will pay for those as well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
This is hope.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Some update for Swiss ?  I am a Preorder code user
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
It should be possible if payload is simple enough. Whole point is that you pretend to be a keyboard.

In theory it should work with any interface that supports keyboard.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
My address got locked in a couple weeks ago but nothing has shipped.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Just checked and my white pre-order hasn't changed but im still hoping something comes up
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
surprisingly not all that helpful in figuring out when an individual unit will ship.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
WOOT!
Wow you have been busy.
Verified = downloaded.
Now to play. Haven't been able to get this back on my device since enabling advanced security on Android.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Already in stores
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Almost exactly the same as my order, and about the same situation. I had 1 white and 1 black unit, 2 covers, a wifi board and a package of dev boards. 

They said some black units will be shipping in this batch...

Here's to hope!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I just dont want to buy one of the loaders
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I wanna know too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Same here, hopeful, especially given the number of them in this batch!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Im going to mess around with it more later on
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I received an email a few hours ago that mine will ship soon. Hope that confirms mine is in this batch! I ordered a Black Flipper Zero and am in USA.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Woah, that's actually a really good question. Not sure if this is possible as all the injection method I know act as USB hosts while the flipper can only act as a USB peripheral, but maybe doing it this way is possible too
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Because I think its inappropriate to resell (likely at a profit) a fantastic project from a crowdfunded company.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Orange? I thought there was only black and white?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I know but Ill still cry in the mean time, backer squad Im used to waiting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Any plans for having the app in the play store?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Shipping order is based on the amount of orders placed per region, Europe is up next :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
I just received an email less than two hours ago asking me to confirm my shipping address, so it looks like it's actually happening this time.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-06
Damn bro I keep hoping that because they are Europeans behind this theyll remember we exist or ship their sooner but nope.

No, no shipping info.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-05
I havent even gotten my shipping information for just the regular white flipper 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-05
Nope
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-05
I had my shipping addresses locked in a couple weeks back for mine, hasnt shown up though. I had two units, to rubber covers and a Wi-Fi dev board, so I would assume theyre shipping all of it at once.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-05
Same
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-05
No. 

Am sad, but hopefully will be happy when it arrives. 

I'm gonna be sitting by every gate, hidden in the bushes, trying to snag codes!

Work RFID badges will be fun too, I'm excited to see if they're as dumb as I expect or if they're gonna be a hassle to duplicate.

So much to do!

1 : 2022-04-05
I see several, but i wouldnt pay those prices, most havent even shipped yet and sales reopen in may at retail, so unless you need it now, id wait 2 months and save $200

Just got mine to update with databases!  
Was getting the same errors. After watching the device go back to the home screen while qFlipper app was still waiting I impatiently disconnected and reconnected the device before qFlipper timed out and it continued the update process by removing unnecessary files and updating databases. Seemingly all good now. YMMV

There are publicly available databases for flipper. We planning to create website to share them soon.

If there is no original remote ?

Thanks you for clarifying.

Every year, reddit does an April fools experiment. This year they brought back (for the first time ever) a previous iteration from 2017 called r/place. It began as 1000 x 1000 blank canvas where any redditor can place 1 pixel every 5 mins. 

We made art and a lot of subs banned together to get their graphic or whatever onto the canvas. This year it was different as they doubled the canvas twice! 

I still want to see flipper on it somewhere.
-------------------------------

That is a good question.

Originally WiFi module was born as a replacement for STLink Debugger module. Main goal was to allow flipper debugging without proprietary components. For this purpose we ported blackmagic debug probe to it. Currently it supports debug over usb or wifi and access to flipper serial ports.

Also you can debug other MCUs that is supported by blackmagic and even use it as stand alone ESP32-S2 dev board.

But thats not everything, we are open to new ideas and contributions. So feel free to create issue on github: https://github.com/flipperdevices/blackmagic-esp32-s2
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-03
Baumann,  you know "what's up" Thank you for that.  It's going to be hard  to ask MGMT for the in house remote and then use it to copy a single key right in front of them discreetly XD
-------------------------------

Yeah it's crazy, if Steam deck was priced by scalpers the same itwould cost at least $1600 and that's the starting point, people are crazy

Good luck! I havent received mine yet and the cheapest Ive seen them going is for about $450! I checked because I wanted another

anyone know the est shipping date for the wifi boards. they weren't available when the kickstarter was active. tks, /guy

Being a radio nerd all my outside garden lights, mower remote start, basement bar lights, etc, are on done by mainly RF remotes and some IR, I wanted to learn more about RF and make so I pressed one button to turn all on. I been doing this in RAW mode so far:D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-02
Oh yeah that's totally fair, i figured, but i wasn't sure if people just off the top of their head saw that the wifi dev board was an option and just like had a few things they were excited to be able to do with it. Cause i just don't really know too much about what it's capable of doing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-02
Oh okay that sounds cool and convenient! Thank you for letting me know

Maby? I've been editing the saved remotes by opening the .IR file in notepad. Maby can be done with the universal remote. Don't think you can change the image though, But you should be able to at the codes you want instead

Check  https://ship.flipp.dev for actual shipment status.
 The AU/CA/US batch is being transferred from Shenzhen factory to our Hong Kong logistics hub. Due to COVID-related cross-border trucking limitation it takes 4-5 days instead of 1 day, so the shipping is postponed to the next week.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-01
Yes. Its a huge annoyance.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-01
This is EXACTLY the use case scenario this post was made for.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-01
I'm an optimist and I hope it works out, but realistically (just by going from projects like this prior) I think the project will die off sooner than later, or will get bought up by something like Hak5. It's a fantastically designed piece of hardware, beautiful and compact and honestly just kinda beautiful. But I'm also all about early adoption, and I look forward to a small but dedicated group poking away at version 0.0001 of the hardware. 

If it survives, awesome, many happy returns. But if not, I look forward to years of playing around with it, and will buy the next version. If not, it'll be a fun high-functioning curiosity like the Zarus or Cybikos that I still pull out every couple years to do things with (and actually in the formers case, I still do a lot on).

Anyways, that's why I bought two of them. I figure eventually I'm going to do something to brick it a few years down the line and want to have a backup.

1 : 2022-04-01
Wait youre joking right? Thats like the whole point of scalping.

You buy something at MSRP that you believe will resell for more than MSRP.

Its the same reason why someone will buy a super bowl ticket with the intent to sell it at 10x value. It has a very limited stock so you can sell it to someone who missed out and profit easily.

Thats also how many professional scalpers operate. In the midst of the chip shortage, scalpers would make bots that would scour websites for graphics cards being listed below a certain price point (of which they knew they could profit on) and then immediately re-list the item at a higher cost.

Its scummy all together dont get me wrong, I dont support the idea and I dont believe OP bought a flipper with that intent in mind necessarily. But your comment seems to imply that people dont scalp items ever?

Safe to say that if my address has not been locked yet, my Black flipper isn't in that US batch? Is there a timeline to fulfilling the black flippers? I thought I read somewhere that they'd all be going out in this wave, but maybe it was just some of them would be. Referring to black flippers specifically.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-04-01

I know the delays have been annoying to everyone, but since I have your attention I just wanted to say that between this and Discord, not to mention the world going to hell, you guys have done great on communications for this project!

I've been having the most difficulty with the IR toolset. It works great, but is completely inappropriate to use as a universal remote with a hundred buttons. The TV Be Gone feature seems inordinately slow. 

On the other hand, my office HID card and garage door opener clones work like a dream.

You might want to focus your attention at making payloads for what already thus thing can do within the ranges, unlocking should be an optional thing to do. 

Can you look at what mayhem firmware did to the hackrf portapack, they made lots of improvements in a way its more usable. If you can do such sub menus with detailed functionality that would be great.

1 : 2022-03-30
For sure, Ill have to keep digging through your code to see what you changed. I found a spot that very well could have been exclusive to the CLI. I dont have the proper equipment to test those restricted ranges but its nice knowing I can use it if I come across something that needs to use it!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Thats awesome, thanks for checking!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
&gt;Yes, you will have to add individually. The unlocked FW is its own thing, the IR and Sub GHz files as well.

GOT IT!  Just wanted to ensure I had it all set correctly. Appreciate the help.

I think preloaded could just be a misunderstanding about how the flipper works. Maybe they are talking about preloaded with firmware updates, or maybe they mean preloaded with NFC cards like amiibos or whatever.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Thanks u/MuddledBox!

Thanks, the .dfu file installed with no problem and able to see some of the changes like the power button on the main menu. however I do not see any of the [Sub GHz](https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroSub-GHz) or the [IR Remotes](https://github.com/MuddledBox/Flipper-IRDB), to get those, I add those files individually to the respective folders don't the SD card is that correct (.ir, and .sub files)? or am I doing something completely wrong? 

Thanks for all the help.
-------------------------------

Any chance you would be willing to share them I have the Xbox One but no remote and if I buy a remote kinda defeats the purpose
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Your SD card should already be provisioned so no changes should be needed there unless you want to add in other files others have included. 

All you have to do is install my .dfu file via qFlipper and you are good to go!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Complete Noob so forgive me for dumb questions.  
I assume to get the unlocked version I just download and install the "flipper-z-f7-full-local.dfu" form file the firmware update.   


Then for the Sub-GHz, I assume I download the folder and install each individual file in the Sub-GHz folder on my flipper? is this correct?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
My guess: "pm" means "private message".

No idea what "preloaded" or "the bag" are.

1 : 2022-03-30
Ah! Good find! I have resolved and will be releasing the new version soon!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Here's my bad interpretation:

\&gt;Looking to buy one will pay over pm

Looking to buy a flipper, will pay over (MSRP?)

\&gt;Preloaded gets the bag

(No idea what preloaded means in this context) gets my money

Any ideas?

It definitely does TX outside my region-lock ranges. 

I just verified, just in case, and flashed the official. FW. I tested again and received the 'can not tx' message and got no output on my SDR. Reflashed newest MuddleBox. Retested and got successful TX on the locked frequency that failed on the official.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
That's good then, can you check these ranges in this function against your region to see if it is actually transmitting in a range that you shouldn't be able to? I don't have the equipment needed to check it -

1 : 2022-03-30
Hey man! Was thinking about reaching out to you - actually your firmware doesn't bypass the region locks. It looks like it does because there's no message on the device itself, but if you try to use the CLI through the device there's a message about it being region locked and not allowed to transmit on those frequencies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-30
Unsure. I checked out of the hotel
-------------------------------

You can look through the releases history to see:

[https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware/releases](https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware/releases)  


The big thing is supposed to be an "unlocked" subghz module, but they added a few new ranges to the selector. There's still another piece that needs to be changed in the firmware to actually allow the device to transmit on those ranges if it is region locked, but I don't know legally if anyone is going to publicly release firmware with that modification. It's a fairly simple change though - and then you need to compile it yourself.

Try emulating your TV remote or AC remote in the IR section first. This will give you kind of an idea for how the system works and how to label stuff. Make sure to upgrade your firmware first.

Doing it wirelessly might not be possible but you should investigate whether you can do something with badusb with it physically connected to the xbox. I think the xbox let's you connect any standard keyboard and mouse https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-keyboard-and-mouse-on-xbox-one-4767301#:~:text=Xbox%20Controls%20on%20a%20Keyboard%20%20%20Function,Space%20or%20Enter%20%208%20more%20rows%20

Yeah the fact we don't have any third party wireless Xbox controllers suggests it's not so easy to do. Further they are 2.4gz ala wifi and flipper can't handle that without an external module. 

That all said you might be able to do more than you thought with just IR. As I recall the Xbox media remote is IR only but provides a button mapping for all most all of the controller buttons. I believe this was done so any media player app that used the controller could be made to work with the remote. 

These remote codes might get you started

I kinda doubt you could do in-game controls with this. 

Power options are one thing because they can/do use IR for communication, but the rest of the controller uses a special "proprietary" wireless standard. 

Hopefully I'm wrong but I don't think so. If the US ever gets any black ones across the border I may be able to play with it some and find out.

The universal TV remote on my flipper has a mute function. Have you tried updating the firmware on your flipper? I'm sure there are multiple repos out there for this, but I've found the [MuddledBox IrDB](https://github.com/MuddledBox/Flipper-IRDB) to be quite good. You can also have your flipper learn the functions on your own remote
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-28
If you check the plugins, they included a little snake game too!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-28
I have not been able to get mine to turn off my home TV. I haven't uploaded my TV's IR library. I was hoping that the universal TV database would work. I'll have to try it at some other location.

No, Flipper can't act as a USB host, only as a peripheral. This is a limitation of the USB controller chip we're using.

The last week I have added a new plugin to flipper. Using the snake app as an example Im currently building flappy-bird.

All my code is open source, in the commit history you can see how I register the application in flippers menu. And adding a entry to the make file to get it build. 

For the application to work, you will need a function that works as a main that registers event / frame-draw callbacks and keeps the app alive. 

Feel free to ask questions about flappy bird or build issues of your own. My goal is to write a tutorial for a basic hello-world app soon!

Core2 firmware update normally takes couple minutes.

qFlipper uses low level access to usb device throw WinUSB subsystem.

There are 2 drivers that we are using: stm dfu driver(new one) and libwdi winusb. Both should work fine. Normally qFlipper installer provides correct driver and replaces legacy one. In the past we saw couple reports that some old drivers from STM and Android may prevent qFlipper from accessing device.

If you have problem with update please report issue to https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper/issues.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-27
So it is acceptable for the update to continue this way, 2 bytes at a time, for over 12 hours?  I just want to make whether the correct action is to allow it to proceed as it currently is, or to unplug and try again.

Also, is the correct driver for the "DFU in FS Mode" device the "STMicroelectronics" one dated 5/7/2018, version 1.1.0.0, or should the flipper DFU be using the "libwdi" version 6.1.7600.16385, as reported on the wiki?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-27
It's more about starting Core2 in update mode and waiting till it be read for work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-27
Pretty much. Like for all you know someone had a major bill come up and they're trying to get enough for their flipper because they seen the demand to cover an important bill.

Sure theyres people who planned on buying them and flipping them (haha) but if they weren't making a profit they wouldn't be selling them so if you don't have a flipper you'd still be without one either way

Yeah rit dye works the only problem is that you should use hot water. Some plastics can shrink it warp in the heat.  I've had good success in dying polymer rifle magazines. But those are made to withstand heat and abuse.

Then work backwards from there, where holes will need to be for the sensors and such

I was thinking along the lines of a tube with fancy ending with maybe sensors, speaker inside that would connect to Flipper via GPIO and an add-on to use it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
I hope that's the case so I can get my device and it's accessories after a two year wait.

It's a group that puts out sub-ghz RF recordings, IR libraries, 3D printed case sketches, and a fork of the flipper zero firmware that unlocks Tx on restricted RF spectrum (among other enhancements)

I don't get why people get so mad at scalpers. It's one thing If they're buying them all up to sell them at a higher price but if you don't like the price don't buy it. 

They'll either have to come down on price or someone else who doesn't want to wait because they're impatient will buy it. 

It's not like they're selling stolen flippers.

Yall are getting emails? I havent received anything. I bought of the preorder store.

Looks like the MuddledBox crew already merged the 0.52 changes into their latest release: [https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware/releases](https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware/releases)

Fun fact: if you report a seller on eBay they actually default to being on the clients side.

Now Im not telling you to report this for being a tool that glorifies hacking or anything, but what I am saying is if someone where to (hypothetically of course) report it as such to eBay it would most likely be taken down.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
I can imagine the reason being that, since they were delayed they are rushing orders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
bruh i'm backer 2,800 and i havent even had my address locked, wtf
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
Backerkit doesn't even show my address being locked, just the order, I backed early 2020 when the project had like $12k in funding, and I paid for shipping April 15th, 2021. Pretty dissapointing that there isn't prioritizating in terms of those who have been waiting quite literally years for theirs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
First email is 1 week before locking. Second email is 48 hours until locking. It's in the latest update.
-------------------------------

Nobody buys a single item of something with the intention to scalp it...   The profit is rarely ever worth the time invested, let alone costs incurred that you don't get to pass on to the customer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
its not got the functionality in place for scanning pet chips FDX-B at the moment, the hardware is in place so im sure it will come round eventually
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
I don't know what to say. Maybe that made that available only on a small window - but if it's of any consolation, they are postponing the shipment of all the black flippers ..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
Same. I figured it was something to do with the accessoriesi bought. I did notice, however, that my address wasn't ( and still hasn't) been "locked" on the backer kit website yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
probably a newb question but I have the muddlebox firmware on mine, do I need to clear that  firmware in order to get this update?

Follow-on question:

Will I gain anything more with this update or should I stay with the muddle box firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-26
Wow, one just sold for 10k, better increase the prices

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-25
I mean for some people maybe they got it with all intentions of it doing what the videos showed it doing. Maybe they thought itd be easier, maybe ultimately its not for them. On the off chance they decided this isnt for them and decide to sell and noticed the insane demand for this item just went with the flow. Its crazy but the truth is money amounts are relative to the individual. If you wont spend that much thats fine nobody is forcing you to. But dont hate because someone else is taking advantage of an insane opportunity. Btw thinking of selling mine, not for that amount but I do recognize the temptation.

I just tried the same thing on Flipper 0.50.0, 0.51.0, RC 0.52.1, and Dev 969d1efb

No matter how I rewrite the script it just won't use the number line characters on Chrome OS.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-25
The code I used was just STRING !@#$%^&amp;*(), worked fine on the latest version of ChromeOS
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-25
Still got? Dm, if so
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-25
The same characters work in Windows but not on any Chromebooks though.  What was the Chrome OS version you tested it on?

Is there something I'm missing with the way it's supposed to be coded for Chromebooks?  I'm just using STRING but I even tried with SHIFT number keys and had the same result.

The exact same code runs fine on an actual Rubber Ducky so I have no idea what I'm missing here.

Back in the 1990's it was funny to bring a universal remote in to school and program it to your rooms TV and turn it on.

Some teachers were so dumb they thought channel 1 was turning the TV on and would make us watch whatever was on thinking it was mandatory programming.

I can't find the code that initializes it. At some point it's supposed to send identifying bytes to the target computer but I don't see where it does that. Or where it even maps keystrokes to bytes.

You can start by looking at the existing BadUSB code and studying how it works, and then start making your own edits from there

To access the Flipper's SD card, you can either insert it into your PC or use the qFlipper File Manager.

1 : 2022-03-24
To answer my own question in part I did some reading and the Wireless built into the flipper-zero opperates on the sub-Ghz range while wireless mice operate at 2.4 Ghz. This means that I would need another wireless controller to do mouse jacking with it. It's still possible I just need different equipment to add to it.

Never noticed, the upvotes might trick you into thinking that, but it's not the case.

Some time ago they introduced something to 'balance' things, and it's normal for posts to get a bunch of downvotes seemingly unwarranted, and later on end up at 50-60 upvotes. Really no point in paying attention to that number.

Compared to a plastic bank card, the virtual card you have in your phone provides less information and is safer for offline payments.  
  
Apple Pay and Google Pay have several advantages:  
  
They don't allow using captured data for online payments  a normal card can be used for Card-Not-Present transactions (CNP), you can sometimes pay online or on the phone. Intercepted virtual card data can't be used in this manner. After registering a card with Apple Pay all payments go through the virtual token and all operations are cryptographically signed. Reading Apple Pay data results in a PAN and an expiration date of the virtual token, not the original physical card. Thus if someone tries to use the data intercepted from a virtual card to pay online such payment will be declined without a specific signature.  
They don't disclose the card owner's name  some contactless cards can transfer the cardholder name and recent transactions data. Virtual cards don't do that.  
Bank card support in Flipper is implemented solely for high-level protocol demonstration purposes only. We do not plan to extend this function further. Contactless bank cards security is good enough not to worry that devices such as Flipper can be used to attack bank cards.

I kind of liked Capaldi and "Heaven Sent" is one of the best episodes of Who.  The "Bootstrap Paradox" bit Capaldi did is also one of my favorite scenes.  Personally, I'd *LOVE* to see all the living Doctors recreate that scene.  

I probably would have liked Whittaker but I got kind of soured on that whole "origin of the Doctor" arc.

i've been trying everything that 'talks' just to play with flipper and it did read my apple pay card in apple wallet and it dismayed me to see it stored the card number (which apple makes hard to find) and the expiration date. given the name on the account and the security code someone could attempt to use this info for purchases i would think. but i hasten to add i know less than zero about this sort of security. /guy

Considering the Flipper can be reused, and house multiple key-fobs, even if they have no other use for it, it pays for itself in no time - especially if they just use it to program their own keyfob and leave the flipper somewhere safe (so it can be reused over and over and over...)

It's the gift that keeps on giving!

I've cloned my Google Pay instance, but the issue is what folks described below. It doesn't work when trying to emulate it. You can definitely READ the temporary card, but using it is a different story.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-24
Yep he was alright, after that to me personally it felt like they shifted all efforts to including everyone and forgot the importance of a good story. So female Doctor, bisexual companions etc.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-24
It will read the device, but the replay will not work due to handshaking the Flipper can't replicate.

Not saying that it couldn't be, just not in it's current firmware.

Peter Capaldi was a good Doctor, but the story already started to fall apart.

You can read EMV cards (Apple Pay-compatible) but you can't emulate them.

\^\^\^\^ This 100%! Start tinkering with the firmware :) There are already some things I've started working on to modify things I'm either not super fond of, or adding features that I thought would be more helpful for myself! It's not too hard I promise!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Short answer, no.  


Long answer, when using Apple Pay, the request gets sent to your bank with a unique encrypted ID each time. Your bank takes this request and encrypted ID, and uses its own key to decrypt it. As long as everything lines up, the bank will approve it. Naturally, if a request is played once, by the time it is even replayed again, it will already be incorrect due to the unique ID changing from other factors. 

Although, I did experiment on my own card and was able to natively grab some info with the flipper. I can show you what that info looks like if you're curious, but it isn't super helpful.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
If I'm reading the code right, you get \[this\](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/applications/dolphin/helpers/dolphin\_deed.c) XP per RWX and these are the level thresholds:

&gt;\#define LEVEL2\_THRESHOLD 735  
\#define LEVEL3\_THRESHOLD 2940

It's gunna take a while
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
The answer is not really but not for the reasons that most people might think. The crypto isn't all that difficult. And figuring out the NFC again wouldn't be that hard. The issue is what is in the crypto transactions. If you look at the the chip on your credit card it looks a lot like a sim card. Basically how this crypto works is deep in the chip is a number and the chip is designed that attempting to extract the number should destroy the chip. Now that number isn't really pushed back and forth in the crypto, rather its used in the crypto in such a way that the output can not be reversed to that number. 

So if the question is can we have the flipper look like a NFC touch and pay card yes it could do that.

Can we extract your payment details and use the flipper to 'clone' a card? That's where it goes from easy to nearly impossible.  

Its a bit like can we encrypt a website. Yep no problem.  Can we encrypt a website that looks like [google.com](https://google.com), now we have a problem.
-------------------------------

No, i think they might have addresses Apple Pay directly in a blog post - I'd not that then another secure pay method. It's not possible, though.

So for nethunter there's a few versions you can use. Some require root some don't. Kali has lists of specific phones that work well with nethunter, with some of them being really cheap. (Basically there's 3 nethunter tiers, rootless, rooted and custom kernels) The big thing I like using the USB hub for is an Ethernet port, but it's also good for adding an external wifi antenna or other accessories.

These are the official custom images:
https://stats.nethunter.com/nethunter-images.html
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Wow nice list/collection ;) 

..do you need a rooted device for nethunter? Why the USB hub? Which Android version is recommended? I have a ton of old phones sitting in a drawer and this might be a cool opportunity to play with them.. 

My apologies for all the questions.. I am too curious and couldn't help myself ^_^"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Not likely. Digital payment systems are crazy secure.
-------------------------------

Depends what you're looking to do exactly. An old cellphone with nethunter (and a USB hub) is a great jack of all trades tool. Setting up a Pi0w with a male USB is pretty cool (DIY BashBunny/badUSB) the O.MG cable is really really cool, LAN taps like the lan-turtle and Packet Squirrel are neat. The rockPI64 is the size of a pi4 and runs amd64 operating systems so you can get a full offensive distro on a tiny machine, HackRF has some cool gear. Oh! The proxmark is another big one.

I, uh, dont want to rain on your parade, but I got this notification over a month ago and havent had my address locked or received a shipping notification yet. I live in the US and ordered a black case. 

Unpredictable events really throw a wrench into timelines. Hopefully you gets yours soon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I was early in the kickstart, still showing not even shipped. Im in USA

Shit, I still remember when I stopped being a script kiddie. I'd say it's one of the better starting points.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I started out as a script kiddie at 14 years old.

I say, come one, come all. Script kiddies of all sizes and ages are welcome. If they spent the money for a Flipper, they already burned their offering to the gods (with no guarantee of ever receiving anything). They are just as welcome as you.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
&gt; but in the US, it's no joke.

...on one hand, yes, the FCC cracks down hard on this.

On the other hand... in what scenario is the FCC going to find out?

You'd have to be doing something pretty fuckin' funky, no?

If the 'fear' people try to propagate in this matter had any merit, I'd be in jail right now. 

Just don't do stupid shit and this is a non-issue~
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Yee, I'm a bit excited to get it, been wanting to get more into coding/scripting/programming (outside of my job - hard to get into this when the thing I'm scripting is some bullshit). 

That it is a 'beta' device sounds great! Means it's up to Us to make it great(er)!

Haha I hope I make it too! I need to wait to get my hands haha

Perhaps using the GPIO use the sonic screwdriver to increase range of some radios or the screwdriver case amplifiers and repeats signals. 

Just thinking, not even sure if these are possible
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
me personally, i think you'd be better off building 'sonic screwdriver tips' that help the flipper keep its unique shape, and allow the radios along the bottom of it to be unencumbered. i've noticed quite a bit of attenuation just from me holding the device with my fat monkey hands.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Good to know. So maybe just having holes so it has a line of sight out of the case? 
I'll have a better idea once I have one
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
one thing i've noticed about owning my flipper is that you do actually have to pay attention to where the radios are physically on the device when you are trying to emulate something. So, just as one piece of impartial advice, I would recommend against building it into a case which obscures which direction the flipper is facing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
What an amazing idea! Used to be a huge Who fan until it went down hill in the recent years.
-------------------------------

We do have plans for SDK.
But it is going to take a while and will be released together with firmware v1.0.0.

I'll publish firmware development roadmap soon.

Also you already can start develop your own applications, please take a look at firmware source code: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
ohhh sounds fun!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
step 1. clone the firmware repository from github.

step 2. set up docker and run the toolchain (check the README.md)

step 3. build and flash the firmware

step 4. modify the firmware

step 5. goto step 3.

step 6. ...profit
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Yeah, currently the team is focused on the main FW functionality and squashing bugs  


There will be a modular build system later, it will allow custom plugins from the outside, but this is not ready yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Oh, so theres no available libraries at the moment to write our own plugins? Is this something thats being worked on?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
And you can learn how to make games by looking at the snake-game's source code in `applications/snake_game` and using it as a starting point
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
To compile the firmware with your edits (as currently the only method to add plugins is to modify the firmware), follow the instructions in [https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware) (basically boils down to setting up the environment, running make and getting the resulting .dfu file to flash via qflipper)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I just tried to find more information about the plugins. Theres a small Hello World demo on the official YouTube that shows by including the Flipper.h library and then using LCD.print() that youre meant to be able to write to the LCD. Does anyone know if the plugins functionality currently works OOTB yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I wouldn't think an SDK is nearby when some of the functions aren't implemented yet. I would just look at adding your own app to the firmware for now, but just know there is probably a lot that will change over time.

1 : 2022-03-23
Just tested it.

It works fine on both my Chrome OS 96.4.6 and 83.4.4 VMs.

But still just types numbers on an actual 96.0.4664.111 Chromebook.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I didn't get in on the Kickstarter but preordered pretty much the second they put it out last March. Finished the preorder in December. I got mine in the first batch shipped.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I tried on my dog. The blue light would flash occasionally like it was getting some signal. It never actually read the chip though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Yeah, that would help a lot, thank you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
I'm unfortunately the only one at my workplace with a Flipper so I can't reproduce it myself.  Is there anything else I can do to help?  
I can test it on one of my Chrome VMs at work and see if the issue persists if you want.  At least then you'd be able to reproduce it too with the same VM.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
Can someone else reproduce this behavior? I told the team about this, but I don't think we currently have a chromebook to test this on, so more feedback would be appreciated
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-23
don't rly know for the moment. I imagine I'll have to get a certain hz frequence by diverse means and copy it in the flipper. I do not have the flipper rn and I have near zero knowledge about parking lot barriers, but the technology is so simple that I think it's possible.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

BadUSB is easy and fun and you can mess with friends or coworkers (how chill is your IT staff?) It takes a text file and types it like a keyboard. Drop your .txt file in the BadUSB folder on your sdcard, connect to a computer via USB, watch the fun.

To remove the need for carrying around an assortment of key fobs, garage openers for work, my home, vacation homes etc - they annoy the shit out of me with their bulk and one trick ponyness. With a flipper on board I only need that bad boy. 

The part that other guy wrote about removing parking barriers enabling free parking seems sweet ass hell, but to me all that stuff is just a bonus - I just want the clunky shit gone from my life.

You could do all the things a flipper can do with a laptop &amp; right hardware. They don't ban laptops, SDRs, radio transceivers, RFID readers/writers, IR modules.

The only cases where you are going to see a device get restricted is if the device's hardware only serves a specific purpose. For example some countries ban RF jammers but you can do the same thing with a laptop, SDR &amp; amplifier.

No, that's not an expectation, but an option

A more likely option is an SDR
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-22
Is the expectation that he has 2 flippers? That seems rather unlikely
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-22
If you just try to emulate a random signal it might look like it's doing nothing, but the flipper is actually transmitting data

Can you check that with an SDR or another flipper?

Are you sure it does nothing? What are you expecting it to do when you emulate the signal?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
If you can read frequencies, the flipper itself is not damaged, instead its likely a software issue with the sub ghz antenna.

First thing I would do is make sure youre on the [latest firmware](https://flipperzero.one/update). The version it ships with is buggy and may not function as intended. 

If the problem still persists, go to the [discord server](https://discord.gg/87bJuY4J) and look in the sub ghz channel. People who are active there will definitely be able to help you out or at least point you in the right direction.

Which part of Kanada? I'm BC and hoping I'll get my pre-order shipping soon...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Totally understand the feeling, its been a long wait bu it'll be on your doorstep soon and you'll have heaps of info from other peoples time with it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
You can add there:
- US backers who didnt receive the item for 2 years; happy flipper US owners that pre-ordered 3 months ago


PS: for those who gonna say they dont understand this type of mentality, Im not even based in the US.

I only had the option of getting a white; I would rather have had a black.
-------------------------------

Fork with some changes that removes regulation requirements and adds extra frequencies.

Extra frequencies already added to 0.51.0-rc. As for tx limitations: they are part of certification process and we must comply.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Got my email about midnight last night. Includes black flipper, silicone case, wifi board and photo shields.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Someday I'll get mine. I made the mistake of giving them too much money... 

I'm really not mad at them, it's probably the best communication and honesty I've ever had from a kickstarter, I'm just bummed. everyone else is leveling their dolphins and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching. 

On the plus side, there will probably be lots of guides, videos and githubs to pick from by the time my package finally shows up!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
I didn't see original poster comment; what does "don't spread community across forks mean? He designed a new OS version like a linux fork?  How does this contradict giving back if he made a new fork?

No parentheses?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
One of the three frequencies: 125KHz, 128KHz and 134KHz. Might be it was of the higher ones. Will report later when I receive mine :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Unknown. I did try with stock firmware, but idk what our local (US) chips run on.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Did they do it with the stock firmware and 125KHz chips?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
It's been in the discord and the forums, people have tried and it was determined that stock they're not strong enough to pick up the tiny chips in pets. Apparent vets use considerably stronger antennas (and still have difficulty finding the chips most of the time).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Ugh for what purpose?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
damn. i'd pay into a bounty for that feature, ngl. having a portable, pocket-sized chip scanner would help me save SO MANY kitties.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Currently there's nothing in the works for it, so you'll need to implement it yourself, but we'll be happy to merge it into the official firmware :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Awesome, thank you! Do you know if they have it in the roadmap or I'll need to implement necessary changes in the firmware myself?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Yes, exactly
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
I am interested in that file for experimentation purposes
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
&gt;Anyway, our official position is that flipper is not the device for black hats. Nor we intended device being used for such actions nor we support such actions in general.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand we do support white hats and believe that device name disclosure is not hurting if you use device for this purpose.

Totally agree with this! 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
If application started and script is loaded, then there will be no disclosure throw descriptor.

Anyway, our official position is that flipper is not the device for black hats. Nor we intended device being used for such actions nor we support such actions in general.

On the other hand we do support white hats and believe that device name disclosure is not hurting if you use device for this purpose.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
So in this case, the answer to the user would be that in some cases these can be tracked. In the BadUSB case, upon to the app being loaded, as the device's name is leaked through the cdc usb descriptor. Adding the liability that Flipper Devices, Inc has to disclose customer data in case of a court warrant (due to jurisdiction matters),  if a physical bad usb attack gets through, it would be able to identify the user through the system logs + court warrant.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
So it's just a matter of implementing necessary software changes? No modification to hardware is needed?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Currently Flipper can only read 125khz chips, but reading 134khz ones is definitely possible, just not implemented yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Yes, and there is a name in CDC USB Descriptor.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
If you connect the flipper to a computer before getting into badusb mode, does it connect as a serial port?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
like does he have a car?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
Settings &gt; Passport, or when you connect it with qFlipper running.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-21
1) As it was mentioned there is a official flipper wifi/debug module, which uses ESP32-S2
2) On last hackathon we had this project, check Pavel's blog about hackathon. Team that was working on it made reader and spoofer with external coil and then as PoC spoofing with internal RFID coil. So Minimum requirements for spoofing doesn't require any external module at all.

Would Flipper give out this information if Subpoenaed by a court? 

EG : This device was found in this person of interest, do you have an order number for this unit?

1. The wifi card you can get with the flipper has an esp32 on it and it's possible to do a number of wifi pentest with it. As seen by the esp32 marauder project. You would need to change the firmware on the esp to do this but it's possible. Then have a menu driven serial interface. This is a project I want to be doing when my flipper arrives. I have already been going through source code and the documentation that is available on if this is doable. I might have to make up an sd card reader connected to the spi bus on the wifi module to capture handshakes and such and there is no direct connection to the file system via gpio even by spi.

2. With a simple preamp and digital to analog circuit connected to the gpio, it is certainly possible with the right code.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Yes. Do I keep the quote marks? Do I keep the parentheses?
Does it require caps? Do I need "SENDER-xxx@xxx.com"

How does the correct syntax look?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
You gotta edit the code to replace the sender email (your outlook email) then the recipient aka receiver email (another email) to have the file be sent to.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
This is valuable. I'm trying to get it up and running but the email is never sent. 

Kindly, what is the syntax for the sender-email, sender-password and receiver-email?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
MSRP?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I agree. Its just a waiting game now.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Yes.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
&gt;They have plans to develop an entirely new Flipper for wifi pentesting

Wouldn't that be the flipper ONE?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I ordered a black one it hasn't arrived yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Not yet Im sorry. Ive touched base with my brother who used to work at a 711 here. He said their particular store the signs were manual (gotta use the placards that are numbered) and then change it on their POS (point of sale) system. Point of sell. So thats outta the question. 

Theres another store that uses digital signage but its all automatic. No need for the employee to change anything. 

I have three other people Im gonna ask. They work at older spots but they have displays so mayyyybe. I. Doubting it though. I will definitely update

Rent? Who rents a property with an RF fan? Look this is 2022 where Siri controls the fans with LiDAR. Jeez we werent even using RF fans when I was a kid. Unbelievable. Are you like Amish decent or something? You have something against good technology or what?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Since flipper uses original protocols the only ones that could leave fingerprints because the only technology that does is wifi and Bluetooth in order for you to reconnect with ease. All of the other functions will act as the original key example you clone a security guards access code it will only ever be read as the key you copied meaning if that security guard has permission you do etc etc...

Also you can always modify infomation your device sends out like wifi and Bluetooth since the device is open source to mirror an approved device however if the mirrored device you mirrored also reconnects it will tell the system that there is a 2nd device with the same infomation connected... Think of it as if you handed the same person the same drivers license and another person and they have a photo copy of each license as it's connected on a list of currently connected devices the license would have 2 entries.

Have mine on pretty continuously, no level up yet. The more you use it for scanning, reading, and sending frequencies, the more it levels up.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Nope, not yet for me. I've been using my flipper quite a bit but am still on level 1. Perhaps I need to keep it on continuously? Looking at the source code, it seems there are a few moods the dolphin can have. My favorite is the "butt-hurt" mood, but I have not actually observed it myself.  I'll have to leave mine running for a while and see what it does
-------------------------------

Do you remove all the adhesive off the tape or just get it a bit less sticky?

Lol BTW im not even selling mine, I'm from Mexico and here they will arrive till October so chill bro ... I'm just telling they are people selling this even in 800 since people are desperate on buying.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Alright so I'm an idiot.  Where do you find the name of a device?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Name and Serial are unique.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Name is programmed into OTP zone at factory. There is a theoretical possibility of hacking it and you are welcome to do so )

Also you can patch firmware to prevent it from loading name from OTP.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Is this a digital camera bag?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I suppose it depends on the protocol that youre using
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I'm trying to get one, I'll buy from you, but not for $550 lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I haven't heard of that feature, I wonder if its just for novelty.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I used the packing tape, soaked in warm water. Set a drop of water on the center of the screen, cut the tape to size while holding with tweezers, gently lay the tape onto the screen method. 

The water fills the gap and prevents bubbles, it's exceptionally clear, cleanly removable. And cheap!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Mhm.... tell me more please 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
You need to understand Flipper is using established protocols for multiple technologies. I think youre referring to something akin to a Computer interacting with a network and the network stores logs of activity etc.? 

If so, it would depend on the specific protocol itself. For example, does IR allow a TV to determine if the device sending the signal is a remote or a flipper or some other device? No, its not complex enough to do that. To my knowledge, I dont see a protocol that would indicate you are sharing data with devices you interact with and then someone can determine oh this is a flipper that is using the protocol. Now I think there is a WiFi module out there that can interface with the GPIOs and it could be identified but only the module itself. Maybe Arduino IDE can identify it but I dont think its relevant to your question.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Flipper itself do have serial number and name. But nor we embed this serial nor we send it. 

The only place where serial can be partially reconstructed is BLE. 

Other than that there are some theoretical possibility of fingerprinting, but only to detect device model/firmware generation. Like browser fingerprinting.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I should caveat that with the 'flippers talk to each other' function. I've always assumed something is broadcast for that, but I've also ready that the function is not active in production. I definitely don't see a setting anywhere.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
 perfect Im just wondering the capabilities of it thank you for the answer
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Lol. I basically read this as, "If I use this device to illegally break into something can they tell it was me?"

The flipper does not broadcast identifying information unless you tell it to. The same goes for leaving behind identifying info in BadUSB mode. Although, BadUSB mode CAN leave behind info that can be used to determine that a BadUSB was used, still no serial number of the device though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
devious and mischievous aquatic fucker.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Read how? By what?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
No that SD card answer was pretty good knowledge but what about the flipper itself does it have any individual identifiable codes that can be read
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I don't understand you question. If you record an infrared code on the Flipper, then you can read the SD card and see that code. But I don't think that's what you're asking.

Are you asking if the TV can tell if the IR signal came from a Flipper vs its branded remote?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Well can you tell that the flipper has or has had your codes for a door or your tv ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
What sort of "trace"?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
I do not have a job in pentesting. I just carry mine in my pocket.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
*getting off lawn intensifies*
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Yeah, I was gonna say the Amiibo Converter is a really simple tool at the end of the day since its just reformatting raw binary data into the flippers file format. If a converted bin file isnt working its almost always a bin file issue
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
no, see what should actually happen is when some dick jumps in and buys up as many as he can to sell at double the price knowing there isn't enough to go around we gag him and hang him by his balls till they are torn off. there would be more to go around if scalpers were not buying 10-20 of the item just to sell at a higher price.

scalping is called scalping and not marketing because it's not standard practice. you're not acting as a retailer, you're not adding a margin to cover the cost of your labour and costs to make a reasonable profit your literally taking an item in short supply to extort.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-20
Neat, do you know what else is unique among flippers? Or anything that can be reliably different among flippers?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Have an RF remote for my LED behind my TV.
Try this: use the frequency analyzer to get the frequency. 
Then:
Go to read raw --&gt; config --&gt; 
1) Frequency: drop all the way (worked for me)
2) Modulation: change to FM

Hit back button to exit.
Now hit record.
Press button on RF remote.

Now test send. 
I tested this earlier and it worked for me.
Was bothering me for 2 days until I saw a video on the raw analyzer.

If it works, you can save that and run it again.
Let me know. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Good idea.
Might want to put one on the IR port as well.
You going to go with a glass or plastic version?

Lol. I'm a leadership major.
Inspiring people goes with the subject matter  
Here's the thing: there are so many bright people on this project. 
Here's the other thing: Hacking mindset has changed.
Growing up it was to gain knowledge, now it's bragging rights by many who can't even communicate normally.
Do you, don't let Internet popularity constrict your life!
A case, screen protector, are normal things someone should want for a device that took 2 years to receive and can't be replaced!

Tell you what.
I'm realizing many, not all of you, are kids.
I hope those of you that use the flipper or any devices illegally go to jail.
I'm done engaging people with criminal and childlike mindsets. 

The flipper is amazing, but like many tools, when it falls in the hands of morons.....   things happen to people who act like idiots and do criminal things.

Thanks for that!
I'm still trying to figure out how to use github 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Maybe you should dabble in ham radio, fun hobby and all the things that flipper does with RF would be alot easier to understand, the raspberry pi does that out of the box with rpitx from github for the RF side of things.

I almost got banned for saying black flipper is lame. I can imagine the "Mr. Robot" wannabe with black hoodie.

White flipper is for real hackers. It looks more like a toy and less like a weapon. And it's objectively uglier ofc, even in silicone case.

I liked it, should have kept it posted.
Seemed too soft to offer substantial protection. 
This backpack is soft also but it's concealment under a shirt.
I need to find a hard case and use foam for around the house or travel.

I'm glad this group needed a female voice of reason!
Apologies.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
My point is theres no reason to mess with the sign if theres no return on the risk investment.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
I'm sorry and your point towards getting caught messing with the sign was?
I'm not debating anything else.

May not have heard me the 1st time:
Mhm.
How are you protect your investment?
Are you a coder or do you actually have a job in pentesting?
I've worked in security and used that onsite.
Biggest question asked: where can I get one of those?
Thanks for the inspirational troll remarks.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Yeah, the bag looks more suspicious than the Flipper.
-------------------------------

People who watch surveillance cameras.  Like in casinos, for example.

Yeah, exceptionally shitty, stupid people are always impressive. But you dont even have to thank me, that one was charity, you clearly need all the help you can get. But hey, you know the basics, so good for you bud.

And I am not sure what frequency of ignorance you are operating on to think I would need to sell a cheap trinket that is the size of a pack of gum over just throwing it into a drawer to forget about, but, and let me see if I can exercise some basics here, I am guessing the wave is exceptionally high amplitude with you.

Are you surprised that an overwhelmingly popular campaign on the largest and most popular crowdfunding platform in the world would attract people for who this would be their first exposure to it surprises you. I dont know if Im more impressed with your ignorance or your gatekeeping.

I know you are just using the term Script Kiddie to be dismissive and rude, but if you are shocked that I dont know radio protocol basics you should be able to comprehend that I am not even at a point where I know how to use other peoples scripts yet, so both rude and not really appropriate

But yeah, Im sorry that I am trying to help other people that are also just starting to learn their basics. Turns out that when money is the only cost of entry, and not even that much money, you will get people who are just beginning to learn. You will have to forgive that I want to help other people who are trying to understand the basics, like I am, and am using a community forum that is available to all skill levels to try and help them out.

If you are so disgusted and unwilling to help new people learn then maybe this isnt the place for you, Maybe start a subreddit of your own where you can personally screen out anyone you feel doesnt know enough to participate in your community

No, I was referring to the unlock Jeep code. The Tesla code will work for all Teslas as its a universal code that Tesla chargers use to open the charging port.

That's what I said I wanted to do, but in thought. 
It's criminal mischief charges.
Doing it at a gas station violates state and federal laws.

The way police are these days, you'd be lucky to not get shot while explaining yourself.
The good news is your flipper will be available after your arrest.

Sounds like a garage remote. They are well known to be rather vulnerable.  Another thing we need a flipper app for.
-------------------------------

Usually each station had it own remote.

And you keyed the signs and fuel types by dip switches and paired them with a button.

I'll look through my albums for any FCC #s
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Did each sign have its own remote? Doubt it's encrypted just tagged with a sign identifier. So we walk the keyspace setting all the signs.

If you are talking about the two sub files in the github, they don't actually work. The person who made them in the discord verified earlier that this was just their keyfob unlock they were giving to someone for a test. I think it got swept into the repo by accident.

My immediate reaction was:
Anyone even thinking of doing anything with that sign could get you arrested or seriously hurt.
With gas prices rising...."someone's" NOT going to find that funny.
Better have a really good antenna, set of legs, or fast car if you plan on doing that.

Care to share?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
So you don't want to hangout all day and watch for the attendant to waddle out and change the sign. I mean we got things todo like eat chicken tendies.  So before you go out with the hackerRF get setup a gopro for a timelaps and point it at the sign. Then pick it up and figure out about what time they change the sign. You can do this a few times to really nail down when you need to hangout with your hackerRF. Once you got your window that's when you show up with hackerRF and start recording.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
It'll look so cool tho 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
even better so once we get the info on one of the big chain stations we can use it elsewhere
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
I would assume that the bigger chains are updated automatically by their own system but who knows?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Those are good ideas! I think hanging out at a gas station would be the easiest way and definitely youd get better results with a hackrf with portapack using mayhem fw. So much quicker and intuitive compared the flipper in its current stage. Damn you! Now Im going to be staring at every gas sign when I drive!!!! Dude Im definitely going to try this with my hackrf! Pretty good idea just for fuckery. I know some people who work at my local gas stations. Im going to ask them and get
More information on when and how they change the display numbers. how about the air and water remote they have too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
I have two thoughts. First we should be able to get ahold of the FCC docs on the  sign and controller to be sure to get the correct frequencies. Second we just need to find a gas station that adjusts the prices at a predictable time. Then just hangout with a software defined radio to snoop the radio and we are done. With the wave forms in hand program the Flipper and we are setting all the gas prices to 80085
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Yeah. That probably has no encryption at all. Id imagine its similar to those christmas lights that come with a remote control.  you would have to capture and replay meaning youd actually have to be there at the same time someones using the remote unless theres some type of database somewhere that has all the information  specific to display signs. Its not like they could simply just add it to the flipper and voila. 

Im almost certain the guy in the video is abs employee of the gas station or someone who installs the signs. No hacking going on there lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Two random thoughts, may be way off base here;

1)A mic to make a sort of ad-hoc db meter

B)I plan on adding haptic feedback to mine - linear actuator or otherwise (going to 3d print an n64 controller housing for the flipper)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19

This is a 1.0 product stage  which really means its a late beta. The most important thing early is getting the hardware right as fixing that in the field is hard to impossible. So the software is always going to lag. So unless you are a real hardware guy or a software guy that really knows low level hardware its going to be a steep learning curve to get anything done.  But now that units are in hands I suspect we will see the firmware really start to improve. There will be plenty of qualify of life improvements made to just make it easier to use. 

One I'm really hoping to see is a scripting interface. We can see with the badusb the scripting is really what makes it a game changer the fact that you can use the bad usb to deliver a payload of your own crafting. 

I'm hoping we can get something like Lua , javascript or some other functional programming language where we can upload a tiny code snippet and get the flipper to perform normal actions like read tag, write a tag, etc. It seems the IR has a decent remote control interface that is programmable with a codes file and the bad usb is a decent scripting language.  So we just need something for RF/NFC and possibly the GPIO.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
How did you get past the registration part of this? Did the amiibo bin you have already have a registered user? Mine asks me to setup a Mii and then fails to register back to the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-19
Yes you can already clone kyber crystals, with standard NFC tools the flipper should have no problem with it. So no you dont need to find a 'black' crystal by buying a few dozen. As I recall the talk was the lightsabers basically read the NFC when they light up, in addition to the NFC there is an internal pressure switch. So to emulate one you need to place something inside without a NFC tag (or one that has been deactivated, aka fried) then hold the flipper close while its emulating a crystal and power up the sword. They use the same thing for the holocrons as well. So each holycron has all the recordings inside it and uses the crystal to select which ones to play. 

Here is the google doc with all the codes you might want 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13P\_GE6tNYpGvoVUTEQvA3SQzMqpZ-SoiWaTNoJoTV9Q/edit#gid=1434754068](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVBVM1JlNzgwZWYxSF9GXzd3cWd5VmpxTENBZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttS0VxR0VwQ1FsM3FSU1F0N0JOVjd4SVR0Ul9LQTd4OTVOalMwYWJDbExhcHgtWnJiaGZNZTV2Y1U3VmgzUjlPTDhuQzZkOHZJZ2NXNEl4T3NDTjVNaVRqc1FnT0NkSm1rUXFlTy0yUlFxSnVCTDRodw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F13P_GE6tNYpGvoVUTEQvA3SQzMqpZ-SoiWaTNoJoTV9Q%2Fedit%23gid%3D1434754068)

Here is a youtube video showing how to program 3rd party crystals with a proxmark. The flipper should be able to just emulate the crystal or program one if you made your own (put a rewriteable tag on or in a crystal like shape)

The original FW does not allow TX (transmitting) on certain frequencies for compliance and regulatory reasons. 

Long story short, I removed that feature so you can TX on whatever frequency you want.

I ordered some too. My plan is to integrate the nodemcu esp8266 with the flipper UART serial bus to build a flipper deauther module and plugin. Cmon postage to Australia. Can't express how happy I was when they changed the stm dev board to the esp32 wifi board. Now looking at changing the firmware on that to something like the esp32 marauder with serial controls to use with my flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
you can create clones of kyber crystals so you could emulate that. im not sure how often the lightsaber re-polls the chip to see if its still there so youd have to figure out if its a one time tap or if you have ti place the token there permanently
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
We are working on documentation. It will take some time.

The only reason I said anything was because you said it was a fair price. Now you seem to agree with me that it's not fair... I do understand how supply and demand works, I just look down upon scalpers.
-------------------------------

That's how the rule of offer and demand works ... It's never fair but if people pay por them then it continues the same price

I seriously think flipper is the dolphin from Johnny Mnemonic.

Am I crazy?
-------------------------------

Is there a guide on getting these files onto the flipper. Im sorry, actually using this to learn
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
I have a jeep in those years.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
right  my first tought is   useing the pi to   to act as a connected computer /file server that broadcasts wifi / connect to wifi  or ethernet.   you ucould then  say  leave the  flipper somewhere  in ir rage or   ghz range   and easly activate it from anywhere in the world. or  say hook it up to a pc and use bad usb to turn it into  a key capture or  file transfer device
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
I think you're right. That makes the most sense. The two devices cold make a powerful pair.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
For shame. 

I'll still play with all the others!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Not really. They put foil in the packaging under the Amiibo to prevent this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
That doesn't even remotely make sense. The PS5 is $400-500 MSRP, and is on ebay for a thousand. That's not a fair price, that's scalping.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
what about a rasberry pi interface board  so you could hook up a pi to act as a file server / wifi  board/ many many other things
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
You should use a breadboard with your flipper until you have something working you want to add-on as a module with associated software. When you have something you like and use a lot, then solder everything to the protoboard instead of the breadboard, and then you have a more permanent module.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Thanks much!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
How do we load these files? Can you point out the file tree on the SD card?

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
You raise a good point.
I believe so, but I can not confirm. 
I know Kevin Mitnick demo that same technique using a cell phone USB "cable."
The actual USB had bad code on the firmware.
Think you may be correct that bad USB was just a term for firmware intentionally infected with malware.

Next time I get one in I'll try it

No its for all of them you don't need anyones key fob because this function isn't linked to the car its a code that's super chargers send out to all TESLAS

So is this car specific like the key fob for the door or do they all use the same?

as a script kiddie myself, i am also lost because of the lack of documentation but i'm using my other BadUSB devices as a template for the BadUSB function and using my key fobs and tv remotes to emulate, the more you stick with it the more documentation will arise.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Well, I did it for Happy Home on the DS.  Ripped a card right out of the box without opening it.  (I own the sealed copy because I own the store so please don't flag this for piracy lol)

I actually kinda dislike how rubber ducky gets referred as bad usb everywhere. Wasn't bad usb oryginalny a firmware exploit that could infect other devices and spread?

Just wait a bit for the community to start compiling documentation, when I can afford one I will help with documentation also.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Hate to say it but even if it's not considered "encouraging illegal activity", these can be interpreted as radio surveillance devices which is also not allowed. There's quite a few categories these tick in the banned lists.

Then again, it's not like eBay would know that
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
All of those standards have been around for a very long time and "moving onto something else" would mean millions in replacing metro card readers for eg. I can assure you London's tube doesn't have that money spare. 

Aside from maybe 1button you can expect all of those to be alive and kicking in 10y. 
Unless Yellowstone blows up or something obviously.

&gt; i meant for you, i'm a scrub when it comes to that but knowing the device helps, like i found without additional modifications i can't use a flipper on my fan because it's outta range for the subGHz radio module

It is much easier to give you a bit more information than less.
It saves your search time on the web.
Bad USB is not exactly the same as Rubber Ducky.
Functions similarly, as does U2F like Yubi.
FYI.... It doesn't work on Windows as a security key for login.

It is a strange response? The technology will be outdated because we will have moved onto something else and the flipper will be a paper weight?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Bad USB:
like rubber ducky, which is where you turn a USB into a device that can automate actions on a computer. 

In pen testing, it's usually to drop payloads on the target computer.
It can also be used for good by script, something for you, like opening notepad and writing something.

U2F:
Think of Yubi key. Hardware based token for logging into something.
Like OTP, minus the cell phone, email, etc.
It's much easier for your Google search now.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
You can not, there is metal foil to prevent that.

i flashed back to release 50 and the infrared files didn't show up at all. so i renamed infrared back to irda and the files showed up but still didn't work. i duplicated the irda -&gt; infrared so there two folders and still didn't work although it still only showed the files in irda folder. i then flashed my special ed muddlebogger firmware and still no joy. so if this is working for you i'm obviously doing something wrong. /guy

what kind of forum doesn't allow image upload or attachments? long ago we'd have to post links to an image instead of the image itself, but i haven't seen that requirement for awhile.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
yes, that's exactly where i have them. not for me. i just tired using a card reader to copy the .ir files from the mac desktop to the card and when i go into saved remotes there's now a file apple\_tv.ir and one \_apple\_tv.ir. neither one works.   


i think i need to flash to the release version and try this and then flash back to the mudwalker version. what think you? can you try apple\_tv or roku or lasko\_heater?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Look at my profile background pic. They should work this way
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
that's where i've been putting them. at one point i tried the /SD Card/infrared/assets/ folder, but that didn't work. i even tried duplicating them in /root/ and /assets/.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Also Samsung_tv.ir wasn't made correctly so it won't work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
SD Card/infrared/file.ir not in sub folders
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
i'm confused. the saved remotes are in /SD Card/infrared/ and that's where i put the test files. are you meaning a different location than that folder? tks, /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
I want one so bad but like at retail price..
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Can confirm, this works
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
They said to try taking it out of all the folders and put the ir file in infrared itself.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-18
lmao! well, i might try but i will tell the fb group. at least they haven't banned me for my weird sense of humor yet. nor has mud hopper retaliated for me deliberately parsing his name with every word with 'mud' in it!  


many thanks for the help and at least we know good files should work when i can find some. /guy

No problem this community is just getting started and we're all trying to learn and help each other. I'm glad we figured it out. Now to go and tell the discord lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
yep. same here. i'm so sorry to have sent you on such a wild goose chase due to me not vetting the files first. but it's always safer to blame yourself before you blame the data or software! /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
I added my files in with those files and assumed they worked but I must have checked my own files. None of them are working for me except for mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
ah! so a problem with the files perhaps. this is my first attempt at adding canned .ir files so this was the first place i found any and a few would be quite useful to me. /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Those two are not working for me
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
i reinstalled the 'special' muddlebox firmware and i get the same behavior in that from the main menu i select /infrared/ and then /saved remotes/ where i see all the files in the /infrared/ folder. when i click the one i learned, it works fine. if i click the 3 others it goes to a blank screen for 2s then returns to the menu which called it.  


can you install say the [roku.ir](https://roku.ir) or the apple\_tv.ir file from that github and see if you get the same behavior? i don't see a way to do an attachment here but i've just started using reddit as well. i'm not usually this useless, i swear! :) /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
I use Muddledbox's firmware with your namesake as well and also have the ir folders the same. I can access them through browser by selecting use in app. I assume you've tried more than one ir. Maybe try reinstalling the firmware and we'll go from there.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
Great work.
That needed a TD;LR  
I used edge browser with perfect translation. 
I wonder what would happen if I DL the site as full HTML I'm that state. 
Did you try that?
I've got full blown Adobe which can combine PDF.

i can't find a way to post screenshots here, but i have a learned and saved infrared file which works fine in the infrared root. but i added 3 files from the github  project at: 

[https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB)  


and those are the ones which act differently depending on whether i access them via the infrared horizontal scroll menu at top of main or whether i access them by going into the menu system from the main menu and selecting the infrared  module.  


in the former case when i click one i get a sub menu with 'run in app' and that doesn't do anything if clicked. in the latter the screen goes blank for 2s then reverts to the menu. my learned/saved remote works fine in both modes of access, btw. i'm beginning to suspect the muddleware firmware doesn't like these files or that they have some problem.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
GT! Try putting a single ir file in the infrared folder but not in the assets folder. Let's see if the folders are causing the problem for you
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
lmao! got me! i'm gonna frame that now i'm internet famous. :)

&gt;@chaosmethod81

i apologize. i distrust and dislike discord and am unable to use it. i try to read the new stuff several times a day, but it's total chaos (your namesake!). i tried several things to follow muddlebox  so i could try to cut down the insane noise&lt;&gt;signal ratio, but gave up. i'm mostly using the fb flipper zero hackers group and the flipper development forum for my info and news. and i have github watches set. /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
[http://flipperzero.one/discord](http://flipperzero.one/discord) come to the discord and @chaosmethod81 we'll figure it out
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
tks for the response. i put them there and rebooted. they show up in the /infrared/ module, but when clicked bring up a submenu of run in app / pin / rename /delete. if you select run in app nothing happens. all that is from the down arrow menus you scroll through while on the main menu.  
if you go into the menu system from the main menu and select the infrared module, they show up, but if you click one the screen goes blank for 2s then bounces back to where you came from.   
that it behaves different depending on how the /infrared/ module is accessed seems strange.   
i have no way to verify if these files are valid though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-18
They're just suppose to go into the infrared folder but if they are in folders themselves you have to go to the desktop(where your dolphin is showing) and press down to open your browser and select them that way then open in app

OHHHH yeah... I encountered the same thing. 

I'm sorry, but I just have to tell the story of everything that I did. If you don't want to read it, I don't blame you... Just go to [onlinedoctranslator.com](https://onlinedoctranslator.com) and don't do everything I did.

I am not a good enough developer to wake my Flipper up the way I want it awake, so I spent my time making this in hopes that it will provide reference for those who may have the same goals with their FZ as mine. 

My whole goal with this Manual was to take the entire website and mirror it while attaching a Google Translate API to the front-end of the mirrored site.

I ended up spending about 4 days determined to finish this and tried the \*methods\* below, before I reached the solution that you can download now:

**1.** **Google Translate** [docs.flipperzero.one/rn](https://docs.flipperzero.one/rn) Brave/Chrome Plugin (Works, but will only safe 1 webpage at a time and REMOVES media content - not good enough.

**2. Google Translate** docs.flipperzero.one/rn (signed in w/ google account to retain History) - Same problem. All content is missing - not good enough.

**3. Microsoft Azure Document Translator** \- Signed up, made Azure account. Went through 80% of the process and gave up, because Microsoft is still Microsoft in lots of memorable ways.

**4.** **Rip Site with Sitesucker/Create Mirror Site on Existing NameCheap Domain** \- Tried doing this based on numerous articles that purport to guide you though the process. I haven't built HTML in about 15 years. I managed to upload the entire HTML directory including all index.hmtl files to my public\_html folder. - Didn't work at all.

**5. Convert All Necessary HTML Files to PDF (with Content INTACT)Print Original Russian Dox with Screenshots of Content/Batch Translate All Files**

**6. Google Translate API** \- Signed up with Google Workspace and activated Google Transit API - Followed instructions via guides and articles and github installation/operation - Didn't work.

**7. Other Misc. github Builds** \- There are a few other user submitted GH projects which purport to "Batch Google Translate" PDFs (ALL OPTIONS ARE 10MB MAX) - None worked.

**8. Sign Up for** [**app.lokalize.com**](https://app.lokalize.com) **For Batch Translation Service** \- Upload all documents. Individually set them all for a translate order. Wait an hour for translations. They finish. NONE are translated at all. - Goat-rope.

**9. Check out** [**www.doctranslator.com**](https://www.doctranslator.com) **-** Ends up being the same as Google Translate.

**10. Check out** [**www.onlinedoctranslator.com**](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com) **-** Claims to do what Google Translate does while preserving content. - ! - Attempt to upload one PDF section to try - File over 10MB. EVERY FILE.

**11. Open Adobe Acobat DC** \- Try to save all files as "web-optimized" - Messed up content every time. - No go.

**12. Open Wondershare PDFelement** 

\- Open every file in order of the appearance in the Manual.

\- Individually selected "Save As Another" Option and chose to save as an Optimized PDF to **make sure** each one is under 10MB. Verified all PDFs for continuity.

**13. Back to** [**www.onlinedoctranslator.com**](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com) **-** Individually uploaded and converted each PDF section.

\**ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE WHILE PRESERVING THE HTML FILE STRUCTURE OF THE SITE\**

OK!!! SO.... Now I have the entire Manual translated by individual webpages saved as PDFs that are all under 10MB. Now I have to put them together.

**14. Open WS PDFelement - Open/Verify Every Document in Order of Appearance**

**15. Had to Print Missing Webpages as Directly Google Translated PDFs by Using Plugin.**

**16. Triple Checked Website Manual Format to Arrangement in Wondershare**

**17. Selected COMBINE PDFS and Saved Final Manual Translation**

**18. Review Original Online Manual - Download All Animated Content/File Downloads to Sub-Folder.**

**19. Post on Flipper Discord (UN: UMK)**

**20. Post on Reddit/Other Boards**

I love you all... :-) Godspeed my friends.

Hey thank you!!!! Even though its not finished its better than what was available. Im sure others will appreciate it as well. 

I tried to translate from the .ru domain. It did translate most but a lot of the content was missing after the fact. 

Thank you again!!!!! Its not embarrassing to spend your time and help others. Especially if theyre in the same boat as you may have been before you did this. All good dude.

who came up with list? blank rain checks? pill presses? WTF is going on here? Lock picking tutorials? yet lock picks are good to go? What's wrong with selling a book on how locks work? Kill-Switch activated? So hardware that is bricked? Assuming the hardware is totally killed what's wrong with selling it for parts? This seems like a list of things made up from one person selling one time that ebay just didn't want to deal with the fallout over. So they retroactively added the sale to the list and banned it.

Interesting concept actually. 
That's some brain fodder.
Some of those scanners (vets have) don't look that big to actually be powerful.
That being said.... Making an external antenna may be an actual idea.
Flipper has GPIO.
This was more me trying to scan (my stuff) everything in sight.
Hey a cat, scan.

Assuming you're using Notepad++, make sure you do Edit-&gt; EOL Conversion -&gt; Unix, prior to saving/uploading to the flipper. 

Also, delays, like the other reply said. It's extremely necessary, otherwise those commands run ridiculously quickly and may not be recognized by the PC before the next one hits.
-------------------------------

Is it a fob where they push a button, or a badge where they hold it up to a reader?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-17
HID cards like your friends often have something called APB or 'Anti Pass Back' which means you have to scan the outgoing gate reader after you scan the incoming gate reader, or it disables your card.  In other words, it prevents someone from scanning their card to let themselves in, and then handing the card to someone behind them to scan again.  It's possible something like that happened if your friend has to scan their card to get out as well as to get in.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-17

Cant agree more!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-17
I just listed mine and have to assume it will be pulled, as well; not sure why they'd pull yours, some people have been listing them as "tamagotchis for hackers" which probably sets off some alarms.   


The real name for it as an electronic pet toy/mutli-tool educational device shouldn't raise any flags, but it's odd they say "enable or encourage illegal activity" when so many knives, weapons, computers, etc for sale could be used to commit crimes.

SubGHz picks up a broadcast. If your friend doesn't have to push a button on a battery powered device, you wouldn't use subGHz. It sounds like your friend has a card that he puts up to a reader which is either NFC or RFID.

Haha Im just not trying to short myself .I bought 2 one to flip and one to flip lol. I saw one on eBay go for 500 and other posted for other 2 k as supply decreases and demand increases who knows how high a unique device like this could go for got my fingers crossed.

If you actually get this, i would be next in line to sell mine for that much.
-------------------------------

If you have an inkling of interest in anything this device can do then you should learn how to use it. If you really do want to resell. There is ebay, Facebook marketplace. I would seriously consider learning how to use it.

&gt; Seriously. Searching for a 'drone jammer' returns results for a suspicious kit from China that supposedly blows away the entire 2.4GHz wifi spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt; How to get got by the FCC 101.

It is very weird that's allowed, i have an old school active radar jammer, doesn't even work for the new digital stuff. I tried putting it on eBay and it instantly got pulled off. Sucked, the thing is pretty rare and nolstalgic to some, i was hoping for a few grand. A local guy recently offered me $750, i might just take it. eBay needs to be consistent and they never are.

As the previous comment said, Look at the back of the target device. Itll have an fcc ID

Enter it at fcc.io they have a lot of info. I dont know shit about programming, but I learned A LOT from the various SDR communities about radio. Theres plenty of resources there. You would probably be more comfortable with a hackrf with portapack. 

On the flipper discord Ive noticed that it seems like many people know a lot about programming, but not much about radio. Yin Yang almost

I'll try to grab a pic when I go back in a few days here... I do not have any blanks on hand atm either :o

u r welcome
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Oh, that's not subghz. HID is static.

If emulation is not working then probably this reader got some magic in it. Can you make photo of reader?

Also you can write this data to t5577 blank and try to use it instead of flipper.

I'm using the 125ghz rfid module, I only have the info from the saved signal since my friends out of town...

Should be ok. In terms of signal levels we more look like Raspberry PI. So keep in mind that 3.3V level modules will be the best.

When you use `read` what it tells you? What protocol?

I understand your frustration in making an assumption based on marketing photos, but I do think the onus is on you to understand what you are buying into, it is your responsibility as the consumer to know the details of what product you are putting money toward, and then further refuse to take advantage of the situation you bought into just because you dont like the color you purchased. You paid for white, you just didnt read into the purchase enough to know it, and you refused to take white, which you could have at the very least resold for an exceptional profit and had more money than you started with since you arent willing to use the device in white, because it might get dirty. Which may be unacceptable to you, but seems like an extremely petty gripe to the rest of us.

&gt;That was the only way to feasibly distribute them.

or u could have seperated pre order from backer and set them in 2 lots? they are shipping the first 5k units and 5k per week after that. by the time they ship a total of 20k units i should have recived mine as i was part of the backers in that bracket. but instead im going to have to wait till 50k units are shipped and most people who pre ordered will get it weeks ahead of me. it's the same as asking are you mad the person who walked into the shop to buy that game on release day was able to pick up a copy but you cant pick up your preorder of the identical item we had/have in store for purchase.

as i said, im not too fussed since i don't need the tool but everyone who is acting like this isn't a valid reason to be upset need to get real.

regardless of if it's the easier way to ship and despite that being upset wont change how the shipment is done you have a right to be upset if you backed it in the early days only to be forced to wait till after pre orders get theirs.

+1 - Seeing this behavior as well; cannot run pinned sub 1Ghz from the favorites menu (run in app) it does nothing. I can only run by going into the actual sub 1Ghz menu and finding the saved recordings there, which will then run.

&gt;The playback is fine within the "sub-ghz unlocked" app/menus, it's just the pinned sub-ghz functions in Favorites don't open the app to emulate when clicked on.  
  
From the main screen, pushing down on the d-pad brings up the favorites menu.  
  
Scroll over to Sub-GHz to see saved signals  
  
Click on one of them with the center button to get the sub menu, Run in App does nothing  
  
It also doesn't work if you click Pin, which saves it to the aforementioned Favorites. I was curious if it had to do with the renaming of the menu from Sub-GHz to Sub-GHz Unlocked.  
  
If that's not helpful i can try to record a video

By that logic you can't sell anything...

Yeah. I'll try to edit the title.
Even the mod said it was not likely.
Figured it would lighten the mood of people upset by shipping. 

This is going to be a project of mine now, no matter how long it takes.
Has to be a way, another comment gave me a good start.

If a guy can put tetris on a calculator back in the 80's (classmate of mine), then this device should be able to handle it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Thanks for the info. If you can give me the steps to recreate this I might be able to figure out what the cause is. Seems like I just change FW, record signals, then switch to my FW, and then playback fails?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
ha, I think the down votes are coming from the the image. When I saw it, I initially thought "oh cool, this redditor has had success in porting Tetris to the device!"

I was disappointed to see learn I was wrong, but yeah I agree: It would be cool.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Same if anyone is looking to sell.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Going to up vote you on the effort, but these little babies are worth a fortune right now.
Heard a rumor ebay is not allowing sales.
Whomever is selling one needs to provide some type of assurance so the buyer gets the device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
First of all, excellent work on all of this!!!  
I've noticed that this breaks the "favorites" for the recorded sub ghz functions, I'm not sure if its because the name was changed to Unlocked or not, all the saved signals still work, but they can no longer be accessed/emulated via the favorites menu, though they are still visible for me.
-------------------------------

Are you upset that other countries got their batches first? That was the only way to feasibly distribute them.

looks even more scammy now:

&gt; This domain has expired. Is this your domain?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Yep, that is correct behaviour. There is an API to access storage and we currently working on file browser for desktop and web.

Direct access to SD as block device is quite slow and this option was the best.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Wasn't true when I made this post, but yes, now this is true. Facebook Marketplace, or Craigslist then.

The makers of the flipper zero have said this. The pwnagotchi is something you make yourself, but there's guidance for it. It's a little different in several ways too.

Afaik they aren't sold on their own, you have to make your own

Can you open an issue on github and provide details on what reader you use? Also do you have logic analyser? If yes, can you record data exchange between reader and flipper?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Just got the cables in and it will still successfully read a Dallas based I button but it will not emulate or write the Dallas base code from the breakout wires either. Im at a bit of a loss here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
I've s en mentions of a wifi penetration tool that has a lot of similarities to the flipper zero. It's called pwnagotchi and I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere that it was cited as an inspiration for developing the flipper zero. I haven't seen where to get one or anything though.

Not in a one device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Well that explains it, really. HID(some) is all I need to know. I know the fob is HID. I'll do that, provide more feedback via github when I find my Proxmark. Thanks for the response. I guess from my experience I always thought of HID as rather generic and universal, so assumed they'd all be pretty much the same.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Any way you like.

Can you dump info about this fob with proxmark and report to our github issues?
LF RFID currently support EM4100, HID(some), Indala(some)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Feel free to report exact type of card to our github issues. We'll add it eventually.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Phone read the raw from keycard using NFC tools pro. I have the data in  .Txt.

Tried to modify another NFC save but obviously it's not so simple and I ran out of time.

Hotel cards have data in them. Flipper currently support mifare ultralight, if hotel uses something else then we don't yet support it.

Fortunately I have it. Unfortunately, I'm on the road for 14 more days...

Yep. Re-reading this, I'm either right in the coding pocket or it's past my bed time.

But it looks like your task requires some other hardware.
-------------------------------

Oh no. You lost one?!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Are you saying you'd need 4 radios to build 2 repeaters.
One for 433rx-315tx and one for 315rx-433tx.

Or I guess you're saying :

One repeater.

 433rx-315tx. Listen mode. 

Receive/Record flipper on 315mhz

Reverse repeater to 315rx-433tx

Test emulation. 



VS.


433rx-433tx

Heh. That fermented fruit will get you every time.  
Nah, your numbers were right up till ship time. 
I lost the flip faith.
I'm a born again Flipper  
P.S. these devices are not water friendly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
For example: you have signal at 433.92 received on baofeng1, then you rebroadcasting it with baofeng2 on 315, and on flipper you use 315 to RX this signal.

And same for TX.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Wait, yeah, I meant your numbers. Wine got me tonight.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
The BF radios work great for repeaters and I'd expect good results with the weak antenna in the flipper.

Freq analyzer shows my fob on 433.9xx mhz and the radios pick up the chatter from the fob.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 

&gt;re-broadcast on frequency that is distant enough from what you receivin
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-16
Heavy on the glory though
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Those are some good probability number.
Right there with you.
Oddly just a few months ago, I thought 30% chance it gets here and 50% chance it does what it's told or it gets the hose again!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Between baofengs. Also flipper should be able to receive fobs on more distant range if proper bandwidth and frequency selected. Also default bandwidth is 650kHz, so your repeater should re-broadcast on frequency that is distant enough from what you receiving. Other than that it should work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Swear to God. I said "OK, 50% chance it gets to my door and 30% chance it does all its advertised to do. $160 (or whatever it was) is worth it even still" 

Completely forgot about it for a year. Then the shipping emails came...

The flipper can't sense a fob from more than ~6in. Where would the loop occur?

of course i've seen that
-------------------------------

Yes, ultimately what the thing itself does is most important not what it looks like. Also over time the community is going to mod the crap outta this thing so it's initial look today is a moot point.

I see possibilities there. Semi-related : I was hoping to create a digimon-ish thing for Flipper Zero where you can put Flippers against another and they "battle" each other. And based on the individual data each Flipper ate it would generate different "skills" to use in the fight.   


I'm still spitballing ideas, I need to get my hands on my own first.

If you didn't use the coupon then they can still keep your $10   For example some people bought the coupon but forgot to place their order before the deadline but they won't get their money back either   You only paid for a coupon   It's on you to use it or not

black, white, purple, green, etc doesnt really sway the decision to purchase a Flipper most people. we just want what it can do. if aesthetics are your selling point then 3D printing is always an option

&gt;Testing it on a Courtyard Marriott keycard which I am 99% certain is RFID based on research into hotel keycard manufacturers. The flipper doesnt detect it as RFID but does as NFC? Its really strange, these thin cards I have are almost definitely not NFC.

Based on my experience, most thin hotel cards are actually NFC cards, which is a subset of RFID, but a high frequency version at 13.56Mhz, not 125Khz. Specifically, most like Marriott or Westin are likely some form of MIFARE Classic. Flipper has a post about these two classes of RFID: [https://blog.flipperzero.one/rfid/](https://blog.flipperzero.one/rfid/)

This issue here as others have pointed out, is probably more on thin \_low\_ frequency RFID cards that use 125Khz, but use a slightly different protocol (e.g. newer corporate and school IDs, and some building key fobs).

I didn't say they promised black.
I said they offering in black and white.Then showed pictures of black parts and then said black is no longer available when it was time to order. I would have never pre-ordered if they presented that black was not an option. White was never a viable option for me.

Here's some early cases I designed to be 3d printable. Available here: 

[https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroCases/](https://github.com/MuddledBox/FlipperZeroCases/)

Two main options right now: 

* Snap on cover (print in PLA, ABS, etc.)
* Flexible case (print in TPU or other flexible filament)

Snap on cover is tested but comes off a little too easy. Still good. The flexible case is untested as it is super thicc and has so much padding.

Get the fuck out of here? Really? What about software defined radios like HackrF, proxmark3?

I am amazed that this kind rhetoric still exists when it comes to IT security. I mean I could imagine somebody saying something like this 15 years ago. But in 2022? Thought we were past this childish bullshit .

Ah. Flipper pirates  
Been reading about them.
Might need to start setting up glitter and fart bombs to stop this flipping piracy!
I'm still trying to figure out all the uses for mine.
Main use is U2F right now and assist people who brick theirs.
I bought mine to ruin the super bowl   by changing TV to home and garden channel during big plays, and turning off AC and fans.... they didn't come in time.

Supply and demand, they arent selling them if you didnt do the kickstarter.

This would make sense. Someone else pointed out this might be the situation and suggested making the flipper capable of reading raw data regardless of format. 

As for my unit, I'll see if I can test with a 100% supported RFID as was suggested, just for peace of mind on the hardware.
-------------------------------

Omg...how do you add that to the actual device?
Can it be dragged onto the SD card?

Well I will. Enjoy the black one more anyway which is why I picked black plus its harder to notice something black in the night versus a bright white object.

Also technically all the white owners are all testers as black will probably get updates and fixes for what white owners discover bugs and issues.

I thought it was a little weird too. White hat hacking and diagnostics, for instance, can be helped by tools like Flipper. But I also see where they're coming from--I would be wary of liability concerns if I were running a marketplace.

From my understanding If your remote uses code to communicate with the garage opener it wont work. Try taking the remote out of range of the opener. Record the signal while pressing the remote. Then return to the opener and replay the signal. Theres a lot of variables including modulation. Im no expert lol but it took me a while and again the sdr guys are a wealth of information. IMO it was easier to use the hackrf, but that may change once flipper starts to get updated and people begin creating scripts for it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Youre welcome. So it doesnt pick up any signal or is it that the garage door isnt opening once you replay the signal?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Thanks for taking the time for such a detailed response. 

I tried both your suggestions, found the FCC info but still nothing. I think it might be a hardware problem?
-------------------------------

Wow! I wish I knew how-to code .. anyone know if there's a vid out there on how to code just for Flipper Zero?

Try putting the other remote as close to your Flipper as possible when you scan
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
I'd be using a couple of baofengs tuned to 433mhz with a repeater cable.

The radios pick up the chatter from a key fob across typical vehicle use ranges and the flipper frequency analyzer sees the BF radio transmission like you'd expect

I have renamed the irda folder to infrared and ensured the file path is correct as you show above. however it only sends the command for a fraction of the second when I click a button on the universal remote. This seems to break the remote entirely

Haha, that was me. Sadly, the models I had are a bit out of date, and don't fit my unit (they've changed the pogo pin positions for the iButton).

Working on adjusting the models.

I've got a remote that I've been trying to get my flipper to read.  According to the FCC id the frequency range is 304.25 MHz.  Any way you could add this your firmware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
I used to have every amiibo bin saved to that gif repo and their corresponding NFCs but I was advised to remove them for copyright reasons if you make the raw_amiibos directory and throw an entire dump of amiibo bins in it, you can convert them all in mass by pointing the code at the directory (it will recursively search through any directory you give it including sub-directories)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Yeah it would be cool to be able to download an ambio bin with your phone. Then use the phone app to push it to the SDcard. Finally just load it and go as needed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Try raw_read and click record. My frequency analyzer was jammed for some reason until I tried to record with raw_read and then everything worked again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Already talks about making a dedicated amiibo plugin that can read Bins off the SD card and directly convert them on fly for emulation. It might be a bit before its ready though as the firmware is still sub v.1 and plug-in loading Isnt fully implemented yet
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Was scrolling through Reddit, didnt expect to see my GitHub here XD (VapidAnt in the discord)

Some others in discord deserve credit too, they wrote the more infant version and I wrote this version which eased use and fixed a large bug in the assembler.

Ill refactor this git more in the future to make it better to use! Feel free to make pull requests if you have any improvements

On your SD card, change the "irda" folder to "infrared". You will find your saved remotes and the brute force IR remote work.

Also following for this master list!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
The analyzer is very short range. Try touching the clicker against the flipper and hold the button down for a sec or two. The frequency should show up on the screen. Then on the flipper go to record but change the frequency to the one that closely matches. Now keep the clicker close, press record on the flipper and then press the clicker. You should see a spike. Stop recording. Then try to replay it. If you have an older garage door it will work. Newer ones it wont. 

I have an older one from around 2007. I cant get it to replay successfully on the flipper yet, but Ive done it plenty of times with the hackrf one w/portapack abs mayhem firmware. Takes some reading to understand but the SDR community is full of very useful information. 

Another method to determine the frequency of your transmitter is to look at the back of it. It will have an FCC ID. Copy that id at this website. FCC.io 

Youll find the frequency easily.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-15
Attempted this update, but as other have mentioned it breaks IR, remote. I lose saved Remotes (though the files are still on the as card). Also, the universal brute force remote wont launch.

Based on what I've seen in discord, plugins cannot be installed and must be compiled with the entire firmware package.  
You can definitely start writing plugins.  
There are a few people on discord are submitting semi-modified firmware right now. I'm sure you could do the same thing with plugins.

Unfortunately the online manual and references for developers are ONLY in Russian right now.

Don't worry though. I'm working on a Flipper Zero Missing Manual right now with translated versions. Stay tuned...

&gt; The middle card is an HID ISOProx II.

[There are different protocols and formats available for HID Prox cards.](https://www.proxsource.com/resources/how-to-order-prox-cards/prox-card-options/prox-card-formats/)  Flipper only understands the EM4100, H10301, and I40134 formats and I've been able to successfully read and emulate the basic H10301 26-bit format that is pretty common in older facilities, but it does not understand 35-bit Corporate 1000 or 37-bit H10304 formats that are much more common in HID cards at newer and larger facilities.  You probably just have a HID card with an incompatible format.

except they are, we all lined up at the same time. people who have to wait because the black ones are not ready and those who ordered white after them is more akin to your example.

that is fine for those who ordered different colours it can't be helped but that's not what happened and of course, myself included, will be upset erritated that i paid years ago and my shipping isn't even locked yet while others who ordered after me have apparently recived theirs or it's at least shipped already.

im not too fussed since it's not a tool i need but there's no reason people shouldn't/cant be upset about it.

Somebody probably remotely hacked you with one their Flippers. Somebody discovered a sub-routine that allows for backdoor access via another flipper. Word is on the street theyre calling it DarkFlader. Ya know like the dark side, Vader, Star Wars bla bla. Just be on the look out for anyone near your home that looks like they are using a mobile device. I heard there was a feature to detect nearby flippers but since yours has gone to the dark side you may find someone with a working flipper.

You try this?

Full recovery mode
If the bootloader is corrupted, rebooting
into update mode will not work. There will
be no image on the Flipper screen and the
status LED will not work. In this case, only
the full recovery mode will help restore the
device.
To activate full recovery mode:
1. Disconnect Flipper from USB
2. Press and hold the (O + back) button for 30
seconds
3. Connect your device to your
computer
4. Restore the firmware according to the
instructions: restore the firmware

Highly requested so happy to contribute. Are you getting the "this frequency can only be used for rx in your region" message? 

Well this firmware fixes that! 

This is a firmware allowing for unlocked TX and RX on all of the below frequencies: 

    "300.00",
    "315.00",
    "348.00",
    "387.00",
    "433.08",
    "433.42",
    "433.92",
    "434.42",
    "434.78",
    "438.90",
    "464.00",
    "779.00",
    "868.35",
    "915.00",
    "925.00",
    "928.00",

Also note, code changes can be seen here: 

https://github.com/MuddledBox/flipperzero-firmware/pull/1

Testing and working on my personal Flipper. 

Let me know if you experience bugs and I will update from there.

You got the mod helping but did you try this?

Full recovery mode
If the bootloader is corrupted, rebooting
into update mode will not work. There will be no image on the Flipper screen and the status LED will not work. In this case, only the full recovery mode will help restore the device.
To activate full recovery mode:
1. Disconnect Flipper from USB
2. Press and hold the  (o + back)  button for 30 seconds
3. Connect your device to your
computer
4. Restore the firmware according to the
instructions: restore the firmware

1 : 2022-03-14
Thanks! As it seems that is not yet documented, and in case you pursue that plan, would be nice if you could share back with the community so we have some progress by the time the rest of the world gets it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
I'm planning on doing some of that too, although the "plugins" aspect is another thing that needs to be implemented. Currently you have to write to the firmware in order to get code to run on it.  


I've cloned the firmware repo to start looking around to see if I can figure anything out. Good luck to you once you receive yours!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14

Thats not an issue for me, at least, as one of my intentions is to contribute to the firmware and/or develop my own plugins.

1 : 2022-03-14
Honestly, unless you are a developer who is looking to contribute to code, I would wait for the firmware to be more fleshed out before buying one. I got mine the other day, and it's nice to see in person (great build quality) but it's not the most useful thing today. Support for certain RFID cards is still coming (can't get my apartment key to read), as well as some of the other features like Arduino packages.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
Not exactly last, if you live in the US, independently if you've pre-ordered or if you're a backer, you'll still be one of the firsts to receive, still ahead than Europe, UK and the rest of the world.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
same here willing to pay over
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
You wouldn't get yours faster if they had withheld pre-orders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
You dont understand the concept of order or lines?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
Try being one of the first to order but picking black so Im last to get one.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
For what it's worth, I got mine the other day and the firmware is still fairly early. Version 0.5, so some of the features aren't even implemented yet, like "dumb mode" which will let you disguise Flipper as a toy.  
There are also a lot of people in the discord complaining that certain RFID cards are not scanning. Including one of my access cards.  
From what I can tell, this is because all of the protocols are not fully implemented yet. So by the time you get yours there will probably be at least a little bit of progress made toward these issues.

Why is it unfair though? They had enough product to meet all of the backers and some of the pre-orders, so they sent them. You're saying that they should have just withheld half of the devices until the next shipment to make you feel special?

Im not expressing any anger nor frustration to whom received it. Backing a project is about putting the consumer at a risk of buying something that might never be delivered. I know what I was up to when I backed the project. I was patient for about 2 years, i actually thought I was receiving the product at the beginning of last year, waiting for more 2 months wont be a big issue for me. Still, with all that in mind, it is still unfair that the company decided to place pre-orders and backers in the same bucket.

They shipped out flippers in large batches, grouping them by region. Being the size they are now, it wasn't feasible to ship out orders in the order it was placed. 

I'm excited too. The wait had been very long for me but it's finally coming up
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-14
I am experiencing the same issue. had the flipper for 3 days now. The read writer I use in my 125khz cards is the Keysy very simple device but works flawlessly on anything I have thrown at it so far read/write to its proprietary cards or transmit from from device it self. upgrading firmware again now to make sure it is up to date. then I will make a video as well. does read bank card. frequency scanner works well to.

**How to check 125khz RFID**


1. Install SD-card and update firmware to latest version. You can switch update channel to DEV to get bleeding edge version [https://flipperzero.one/update](https://flipperzero.one/update). Check firmware version in `Settings &gt; About`
2. Try to read `125khz` tag that Flipper should 100% support, like `EM4100`
3. While reading,  do not move Flipper over the card, just put it on card and hold still, like in this video [https://cdn.flipperzero.one/rfid\_long\_reading\_demo.mp4](https://cdn.flipperzero.one/rfid_long_reading_demo.mp4)
4. If it doesn't read, try to reboot device (press `Left` + `Back`)
5. Repeat process
6. If it still doesn't read, record the video demonstration, upload it to file sharing, and send link to [support@flipperzero.one](mailto:support@flipperzero.one) with your Flipper name and serial number from `Settings &gt; About`

Antenna is soldered to pcb, but there are 3 matching networks that works only with this antenna, so it's not replaceable.

All those cards have their own memory and protocol to access it. On physical layer all of them supported, on software level it's require some research and work.

You can analyse them with some other tools and post issue in our github with details.

We may get those cards later and did it ourself. Just need some time for it.

There is a pin on external connector that duplicates iButton pogo pins, you can use it to verify.

If it is still not working: there may be some readers sensitive to timings or levels. Some issue may be fixed with software, some require hardware mods.

- compile and flash (dev version is not rebooting when crashed)
- reproduce crash and connect debugger
- `thread apply all bt`

if you don't have debugger:

- there is console log on ext uart, connect with any ttl adapter baudrate 230400
- setting -&gt; system -&gt; loglevel: switch to trace or debug
- reproduce issue and get logs from console 
- post it as an issue on github https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware

Just a heads up: 

If your car has rolling codes for the fob then don't mess with it. You could desync your fob and have to get the dealership to resync it.

If you want your Flipper to utilize all the buttons on your remotes you are copying then you have to record each individual button to build each remote on your Flipper

Have an RF remote for my LED behind my TV.
Try this: use the frequency analyzer to get the frequency. 
Then:
Go to read raw --&gt; config --&gt; 
1) Frequency: drop all the way (worked for me)
2) Modulation: change to FM

Hit back button to exit.
Now hit record.
Press button on RF remote.

Now test send. 
I tested this earlier and it worked for me.
Was bothering me for 2 days until I saw a video on the raw analyzer.

If it works, you can save that and run it again.
Let me know.

I'm wondering if it's similar to the one at the harry potter world thing at universal, the wands there have a reflector at the end that just mirrors back the infrared pattern that's being spat out back to a camera in the exhibit. What you did was that instead of just using a mirror to reflect it, you copied it and sent it back. Still doesn't make sense as to why it knows you've already triggered the effect though. Also i'm not sure if in your case the signal came out of the wand itself, or the exhibit.

Yup it looks like there may be malicious flipper user in your vicinity. They were able to remotely wipe your flipper with new firmware. If I were you, basically your device is trash.

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-13
Now there's a thought... I can't think of a reason you couldn't use the flipper to host a stripped down live USB environment. The hard part would be writing something that allows the flipper screen/buttons to serve a purpose during that sort of attack.

Running as a live USB instead of a badUSB attack would also have the advantage of bypassing OS based security.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-13
Using "Read bank card" function (while reading bank card) results in immediate BSOD.

NFC-Read card shows "EVM bank card" with ATQA, SAK and UID values. UID Changes each read so it seems the hardware is testing fine. 

Any clues?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-13
Couldn't run it live on the machine in question? Like a live CD/USB drive?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-13
The big issue you'd have with something like an ophcrack or hashcat on a flipper is the flipper having enough power to brute force a password hash. I think a better use would be to use the badUSB feature to aquire password hashes then using a VM to crack the hashes.

no, you just need to press the same key fob, the same + 1 time ... you can make a record when the key fob is in the car's coverage area

from what I can figure out, the protocol on some cards are wildly different and the software in the Flipper isn't set up to decode them yet.

I have an HID0009P RFID card, which should be recognized by the Flipper, but I am guessing that the standards that the card is written haven't been programmed in.

I have other RFID and other NFC cards that pop right up, so I am sure the antennae work

Just a few things:

1. Settings in app is just a big red rectangle.

2. Search icon in the top left corner doesn't do anything when I tap it.


Minor issues:

1. Had to reboot to connect.

2. Did not show my IR remotes under "All" until I switched tabs and went back to "All".

Other than that, awesome! I love the screen streaming and file manager features))

What kind of remote do you have? If it's a Fire TV/remote they primarily use bluetooth. Try unpairing the remote and it will fall back to IR only. First paragraph in my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/td28ov/my_first_experiences_with_the_flipper_zero/) covers how I got it to work. Like the other response, you have to save each button separately. Infrared -&gt; Learn new remote -&gt; then capture the first button. Then to add to that remote it's under Infrared -&gt; Saved remotes -&gt; The name you gave your remote -&gt; the "+" option at the bottom -&gt; capture new button.

If you go to the flipper website, it says out of stock for the flippers but if you look on that page at the accessories you can buy a wifi module and it says it can be used for deauth and handshakes.

But I think someone has to write the software to do so because the website mentions there is no software included.

I haven't yet tried, but I also have an awid tag I'd like to work with
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Well if you are saying so you can play without paying youd be hijacking some kids game while hes there playing lol. They only activate them for the length of your stay. You could make flipper be able to tell you your wand though - but that could probably just be a separate app for magiquest related things. Also storing your wand in flipper would be cool / easier to carry than the wand itself haha. 

Also the wand IDs are a very large integer so it would not be fast at all and youd have to be brute forcing them against a magiquest prop to see what is activated which would probably get noticed somehow. Its a fun game to play as is, I would definitely store my wand in flipper but dont ruin the game for the kids hahaha.

There's been discussion about it in the discord, and the general theme seems to be that the pet-chips are too low power to be picked up by the Flipper. Apparently Vets use a scanner with a considerably more powerful antenna in order to read the extremely small pet chips. 

There's old noise on the forum about the Flipper supposedly having enough battery to theoretically boost power to read them, but if it does exist it's not an implemented feature yet.

So far I've used it for TV's, Air Conditioners, Amiibos, bank cards, running a demo payload, and skylanders.  If you have the beta version of qflipper you can use the built in file manager on the PC otherwise you have to take the SD card out and upload stuff that way. Well backing up all my NFC devices and remotes in to one tomagachi is pretty cool on its own.  It will come in handy at work because we've been sharing one keycard for the bathroom. lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
They dont have a time in them, they always send 2 pieces of data over their IR protocol:
1) wandID
2) force / magnitude

Heres an arduino library Ive used to mess around with my wands even made some smart home integrations with the arduino board for my kids to be able to turn on / off Christmas lights, etc.

https://github.com/patricknevindwyer/arduino-magiquest

My guess is what you ran in to was just the game mechanics where whoevers wand you captured had moved on from that exact quest. The fact that the prop responded at all means the wand was read properly / in the game. Sometimes I think they play special messages if the wandID is not registered in the game (havent paid for the experience).

YES! I forgot to mention it. I got my shipment about 3 hours ago HOWEVER, the USPS site nor the tracking site sent from Flipper showed out for delivery. After my flipper was delivered the USPS site showed delivered.  There was never an update showing out for delivery or anything.

I hope you get yours soon! Though the tracking sites may not be accurate :/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
tks! i don't have much need for using as a universal remote although first thing i did was have it learn the codes to change inputs on my hdmi switch and that works fine. i wanted the universal tv so i could change the dammed channel at the va clinic off fox news! :) /guy
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
the database isn't complete, so most people in the discord are reporting that the power button tends to only work with most devices - the rest of the functions don't have a lot of makes/models listed yet.

Hop on the discord though, there's been some links shared with additional model codes, and you may be able to find one for yours.
-------------------------------

Mine works after an SD card format and two update loops. This is kinda like that old Casio Remote Control watch, although I wish it allowed you to choose a TV instead of always running the entire dictionary.

Im having similar issues with RFID. It works on a thick HID type, but doesnt detect simple hotel thin keycards. 

Testing it on a Courtyard Marriott keycard which I am 99% certain is RFID based on research into hotel keycard manufacturers. The flipper doesnt detect it as RFID but does as NFC? Its really strange, these thin cards I have are almost definitely not NFC.

Im very new to this, so I could be completely wrong. Looking forward to learning more from you all.
-------------------------------

I'm new to this world but just got my Flipper today and can say this is one of the reasons I was excited for it, cant wait till someone has an amiibo dump that works on the flipper.

Just curious, what devices are you connecting the flipper to? Your PC? Your phone? Whats the end goal?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Same.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Not a dumb question at all!  The pwnagotchi works with WiFi and the Flipper Zero is for sub 1ghz frequencies.  You can build a pwnagotchi with a raspberry pi zero w.  If you're ever doing WiFi  pentesting, it's a great tool!

Really fun to build one :)  https://pwnagotchi.ai/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
if you're talking about replay of bank/credit chip cards, that's not going to work - there's crypto chips in the cards themselves to prevent exactly this type of usage :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Might be a dumb question but cant the flipper do the same function as the pwnagotchi
-------------------------------

Nope. From what I'm seeing on the discord I think those folders got removed as they have no data for them yet.

 So, you can expect it to work on the next attempt assuming that the remote is not used after recording.

Its definitely a limitation, but the functionality is still viable for certain use cases

To be quite honest I dont remember. Im pretty sure I did but Ill try again in a few and let you know. Thanks

Ive only got power to work on one of my TVs (no volume, seems a smaller library) with universal. That said I had already added that remote separately and idk if universal scan includes your recordings. I dont think does since volume didnt work in universal but I saved it seperately
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Thanks for taking your time to reply! You asked me different questions on different reply, so I will focus on answering them all on this comment.


Here's a video testing the Flipper still over the RFID tags for ~15 seconds at a time, as well as the RFID duplicator reading each tag. I did not test copying between cards in the video, but I can confirm they will copy between them and work: https://youtu.be/8M7gBuVzVWg


**What card type you have tried? EM4100 for example?**
A: The middle card is an HID ISOProx II. The other two have no identifying marks, but they are copy-compatible with the middle card using the duplicator


**Can you please show the photo of card and your duplicator?**
A: You can see the duplicator starting [here](https://youtu.be/8M7gBuVzVWg?t=115).


**Do you know the card type you try to read? Have you try both 125khz and NFC?**
A: The Flipper can read and emulate NFC without issues. You can see it in action in my previous video starting [here](https://youtu.be/cbBaJUPxz64?t=41).
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Another way to beat rolling code is a complicated "rolljam" attack as defined by the hacker Samy Kamkar. I recommend watching some of his talks on the subject. You can find them on youtube. Its interesting stuff!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
The hack is just recording the raw radio signal. Its not a hack. If the fob is out of range of the car when you record the signal, its still the next code your car is expecting. If you play that code from either the fob or the flipper, the saved code no longer works and the car moves on to expect the next one.

Recording a signal with the flipper effectively works exactly the same as with my hack rf. Ive confirmed with the hackrf months ago that the car is indeed rolling code.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Interesting; one of my cars uses 315, the other worked on whatever the default raw scan was set to.

I didn't realize you could change raw frequency at first, only saw the config option in the default "read" menu. It's kind of hidden a bit on the raw screen.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
That was the bit I wasn't aware of; recording them out of range. I'll have to give that a shot, thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Check it again. Rolling codes breaks the hack
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Hey, I got a 404 on that. Is it possible you have mistyped the link?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Yep, I did that out of the box, but it didn't include the database. 

Had to update fully to the RC release from the dev website updater, then update back to 0.50.0 from the qflipper app, and then it worked properly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
"out of range" is the part I wasn't aware of. That makes sense.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
When I turned it on stock, there was a listing for tvs, air conditioners, and ... I forget the third one. Audio devices, maybe? 

Those other two disappeared after updating though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
It's an HID type card
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Yeah tried both and nothing. It will just continually read for an rfid. Messing with the sub ghz stuff, I think there may be an issue there as well. The signal analyzer reads when theres a signal, but when I scan raw and plug in the right frequency, nothing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
What card type you have tried? EM4100 for example?   
Can you please show the photo of card and your duplicator?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Do you know the card type you try to read? Have you try both 125khz and NFC?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Have you try both 125khz and NFC?

1 : 2022-03-12
I have the same issue. Shows all zeros. 

I can pick up the signal on read and raw. Replaying it doesnt seem to work though. I have an old key fob that Im using for testing. I can successfully capture and replay this signal using my hackrf and my test vehicle responds every time. Im not sure what Im missing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
What other databases are there besides the tv remotes?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Same here.  Not sure what type of card my work ID is, but I haven't managed to scan it.  NFC works on my bank cards though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
All I needed to do was install the sd card, and update to 0.50.0 with qFlipper.  That said, I haven't successfully used the universal remote yet.  I never been able to record and play back individual codes from a working remote though.

Rolling code attacks are hard if you're replaying a recording that the car has also seen.
If you record the open signal at home out of range of your car, you can replay it to open the car but only once.

This has been the most successful function on my device so far.  However, a Toshiba TV did not work with the universal library.

`SubGHz -&gt; read` works only for protocols that flipper can parse right now. Looks like your protocol is not supported yet. But you can use `Read RAW` feautre and then analyze your protocol with the community.

1 : 2022-03-12
Ah, crap, figured it out after finding the Discord. (Hate that this kind of info doesn't end up in the documentation/FAQs).

Apparently once you install the RC release from the web successfully, THEN running the desktop qFlipper app and doing ANOTHER update back to the 0.50.0 release, will actually load the Universal database files too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
Fair enough. I'm certainly not against this kind of experimentation even if I find the end product underwhelming. This kind of silliness needs to happen before implants of value can be developed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-12
I would say it's the start. 

Almost every venture into a new world/direction is janky, however without the firsts to show us what works and doesn't. They fail so we can succeed.

It's not that hard to put something away when you're done using it. Somehow my keys are in my hands by the time I get to the lock.

I'm optimistic about the community in the coming weeks.

I'm also having no luck reading my RFID card. Sat on the card flat for 30 seconds. NFC works like a charm, though.
-------------------------------

Hit me up. There's gotta be an easy-ish way to convert to hex and slap on the SD
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I think I may have figured out the process.

update.flipper.dev

connect flipper via usb, powered on but NOT in recovery mode.

Site should recognize the flipper (rastret connected)

Choose the RC firmware (release candidate), hit flash

It'll go through step 1, flipper screen will change to plugged-in-dolphin.

Green 'continue' button will appear on the website before/during step2. Hit continue.

Web connection popup window will appear asking to connect to the device.

On the flipper, choose settings-power-restart-firmwareUpgrade

Now, the website will allow connection, choose the flipper and hit connect

Firmware update should complete in a minute or two, and once rebooted, databases should show as connected.


However... there's still no Universal TV database :(
-------------------------------

I have tried letting the flipper sit on the cards for about a minute each time and also at different distances (tho no more than ~3 inches) from them, with no success. Putting in the code is an alternative, but I want to make sure the hardware is working ):

The RFID cards are older, but I do use the keyfob daily. That said, I have an RFID 125kHz duplicator that I used to check them and they are all reading fine with it.

Why. Did. I. Pick. Black.

Lol. Grats!  Can't wait till the end of the month.

Sure!

Best bet is to let the flipper sit flat on the card for a moment and not move it. If that doesnt work, you can always enter the card manually using the code on the cards themselves (not as fun, I know!)

Also, are these rfid cards old? Do you use them regularly?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Wait, seriously? Everything I'd read said this wouldn't be able to do anything with a car remote since it's encrypted/rolling codes.

I did try a raw scan/record/replay, and achieved nothing. Is there a correct way to actually get it to replay a car remote?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Maybe it's a joke, like leaving it unlocked is dumb. Haha.
-------------------------------

So I downloaded qFlipperSetup and while it was installing, Norton threw an alert and said Data Protector blocked a suspicious action: the setup attempted to open a protected file.  Anyone know what the process wants with RSA\MachineKeys?

I can try some Samsung Endurance and Evo's if you'd like.

So far no problem using the Chrome translation for me. No timeline that I've seen though for the English docs.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
weird - I've tried a few computers now though, with the same issue. Logs show   


\[RECOVERY\] Exit Recovery Mode u/Tr4se1n ERROR: Failed to exit recovery: Operation timeout  
\[DEVICE\] Full Update u/Tr4se1n ERROR: Failed to exit recovery: Operation timeout
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Anyone heard the timeline on completion in US-EN?  I'd be happy to start using translation from Google if it reads correctly.

If anyone wants to DM amiibo dumps, I'd appreciate it. Haven't searched yet but I have successfully replicated some from ali express so it's only a matter of time.

I'm struggling with car and garage door opener. Nothing scans and raw data I see frequency,but no luck scanning in that one. Even tried hopping enabled. I'll bet my neighbors are wondering why the garage doors keep opening/closing randomly...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I just got around to upgrading the firmware and started playing with mine, and to my disappointment, I'm also having trouble getting it to read Sub-ghz, RFID, nor NFC...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
NeverMind, got the raw read to work. Thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yep, hopefully future firmware shores it up. Would be helpful during travel. I'm already stopped for all the wires I carry.
-------------------------------

 Flashing led.... RGB.

Just finished programming my second car.

I can capture a raw signal from the key but I can't seem to capture with the scanning tool.

Any ideas?

Here to confirm my rfid door badge emulated correctly and worked. Cue strange looks from co-workers.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Thank you for that reply I was thinking the same thing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Pure speculation, but I'm hopeful it's a way to hide the menus and make it look purely like a virtual pet locked behind the PIN. Even more preferable while it's in attack mode in the event it needs to be left unattended for pen testing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Can you share a video of it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I was able to get raw 315mhz to work fine as well
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yeah you could definitely design a breakout board to fit the header sockets and have an sma connector and an amp circuit. But make sure it has flashing leds, otherwise whats the point?!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I got mine today and tbh I'm thoroughly impressed by the build quality
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I tried a raw read to no avail.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Did you do a read RAW? I have the same but Im able to get RAW to work and repeat on some devices that are not secured.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Not sure what it is, my guess is they plan on adding it with a firmware update in the future.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I have a 128GB card that didn't work, but a 64 GB one that was perfectly fine. Seems a little hit or miss.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
What is dumb mode and why can't I implement it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
The instructions state that it needs sd cards capable of "slow" mode as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I was having issues with updating, I tried a completely different computer and, for whatever reason, it worked fine
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
You have to save each button separately.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Now I can't even get it to power on when on USB.

I need this replaced.  This is such a disappointment after such a long wait
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Mine was supposed to arrive yesterday but just got handed over to usps 2 hours ago so depending on where you are it could still be properly en route.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I just got my unit as well. I'm having some battery issues as well. 

On the charger with the unit off I can get a green light.  
When it's unplugged I get "Battery low! Connect me to a charger. Poweroff in &lt;countdown form 90s&gt;"

If I go to the battery menu I'll see 98%, 20C, 4.1V, and 100%
Then it will change and go to 0%, 20C, 3.7V, and 0% throwing the same error again until I hold the back button to get out of the shutdown menu. Sometimes it will flip back and forth on it's own. 

I can sometimes get it to make the same image as OP.

NFC implant. Breh
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
i just got mine to!!! i cloned my nfc implant and opened my front door with the flipper like a boss.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Mine's on the USPS truck!! omg so excited
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Got a couple of metro cards to read on NFC, but none of my access cards will register.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Sure!  Might be a bad driver install or USB issue.  I had to plug mine straight into the machine since it didn't like my usb hub :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I haven't followed developement very closely, is the antenna part of the PCB? and are there pins you could tap into to say, add an sma connector?

Could you please post the link. Im not finding it on the site
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Using a different computer worked, thank you!
-------------------------------

:D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yeah, the English docs aren't quite finished yet- but I'm going to assume it'll be done in the coming months. 

Their [GitHub page](https://github.com/flipperdevices) has all the stuff you'd want to look at (Flipper Zero firmware, the desktop app, Android/iOS apps, even the web DFU drivers) so I'd look there for any information that you'd need.

Hopefully that answers your question, but let me know if there's anything else you're curious about!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Thanks Supa.
Appreciate your not trashing me in the request for knowledge (not kidding)

I am always leary of what something does once plugged into an OS.
Like the driver signing itself, as that can't be torn apart as easily (to my knowledge).
I scoured their Russian docs (translated) and it's way more full of information except..... the driver itself for DFU mode. The link Rick rolls you on the docs page. It has an RU web address but the page never loads.

I admit, I'm a glorified script kiddie for my whole life (40+) so I'm not good at navigating Git.
Is the driver outside of the desktop app able to be looked at? The code?

I still put it on a separate network, fresh windows install, and made it public versus private.

Call me..... old skool in my mindset of Hacking in general. SE was always easier for me. 

Zta in tech and life.

Let me know if you find that driver code, OR start seeing anything odd.
I got off their Discord server, it was literally just people talking garbage.

It's like some fucked up cult of morons that assault you for speaking out against the flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
That's what I ended up doing, then smiling and hitting the hay. Gonna monkey with it this afternoon.  Excited!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Same exact deal here. Departed YORK @8pm on the 8th, still nothing not even an estimated delivery date. I live 4 hours away in NY so its odd its taking 3 days to travel that distance. Im sure it will arrive soon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Rule 34?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Thanks, hope yours ships smooth and arrives soon!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Awesome to hear! Hope you get it soon! Im still pacing the floor but glad to hear Im not the only one with shipping delays and everything is working out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Mine did the same for a few days. Even reset the little tracker status thingy, finally out for delivery today.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
There are dumps of all of them floating around, but the data seems to be in a different format. Not sure if the best method is to write a script to convert them to the Flipper's format or write some firmware to read the amiibo bin file format.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I did get signal recorded but I couldn't get it to actually work
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I try with car key fob .. I couldn't get it
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Trust me I feel it haha. I live in Alaska and we have so many shipping issues up here so Ive been excessively checking it to make sure nothing goes wrong lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Appreciate that! Considering the reviews for OSM I figured my luck was just terrible lol.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I would say possibly wait one more day. OSM had mine in Glendale IL since like the 7th with an expected delivery date of yesterday but they handed it over to USPS last night at like 12:01. So hopefully yours will get handed over tonight!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Today I used it to gain access to my company's building (RFID) and open our entry gate (Sub 1ghz) :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I scanned a couple of RFID cards I have and saved them. Been messing around with the other features too - copied off an ir signal from an audio receiver remote, did freq analysis on car key fob, scanned some credit cards with pay save 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
What things did you do to get it to a HAPPY mood?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
SWEET! Mine is currently on the USPS mail truck out for delivery. I'm super excited!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
My pwnagotchi will have to be alone for a while. Lucky you man enjoy it and let us know what cool stuff the flipper can do.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Haha! Congrats. Mine came yesterday and me and son are pumped.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Awesome. Mine came yesterday. Which screen is that? Music player?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Congrats! Mine arrived yesterday and my son (10 years old) was more excited than me. I can't wait to really see what this thing can do. Enjoy!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yeah true, and from what I understand their park security is kinda crazy. I just thought it would be fun to see what you could do. If they bother you about it, just sat you are penetration testing 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yea, cloning someone else's tag would work if you can crack the passwords (doable if they're using Mifare, but it can take a white) and they don't ever change/rotate them.  That's just going to depend on how much attention their IT team paid to actual good security practices.  Also, if they're on their toes, some sanity checking in where/when it's being used would help reject cloned tags.  If you see a tag buying a tchotchke at World Showcase in Epcot and a minute later it's buying a burrito in Frontierland in Disney, you know at least one is a fraudulent tag.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
You can Google translate the Russian docs. I'm a little disappointed that simple things like adding BadUSB payloads isn't a little better documented anywhere.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Correct, it's just a placeholder for the user token, but I am sure you can clone the token and use the FZ instead, or try to scan another guests cup and see if it gives you free drinks. Just cheeky fun NFC experiments. Scan some of the light Saber crystals, that sort of thing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Wow. I cant wait to see what else we can do with this thing. Hoping this sub becomes super active!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I didn't work on the one at Disney World, but I worked on a similar system for another park and none of that information was actually stored on the wristband.  All that was ever on the wristband was an identifier and single-use tokens for virtual queues.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
That didnt work :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Thank you so much, I'm so excited!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I have a response from the core team.  
Could you please try this:  
1. Settings -&gt; Power -&gt; Power OFF  
2. Pull the cord out  
3. Connect the cord back  
4. Hold the back button  


If it doesn't help, I will instruct you on how to extract some useful logs for us. If it turns out to be a hardware problem we will replace your device.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Heya! Did you update the firmware after unboxing?   
What are the output parameters on the label of charger you're using? Post a pic if you can.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Hi!  
I passed this to our team, currently looking into it.  
Hoping to solve this ASAP.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
 I think only the rarer ones do, had no problem scanning Zelda or Isabelle through the box.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
I used mine this morning on our access control system that uses RFID.  I freaked out our physical security engineer. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Does anybody know if they made enough out of the initial batch to also ship to those of us who missed the Kickstarter but bought one from a reservation I made a long time ago?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Please let me know when you have it available! I actually had amiibos in mind when backing!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Its starting! Aaaa I cant wait to get mine now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
What do you think about it?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Try NFC. It worked for my key cards even though they are 125.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Damn op you beat me to trying this! Super exited it works!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
If you need a decent dump I can point you the right direction
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Now I gotta follow you!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Their magic bands hold your park profile. It's an nfc wristband that keeps your park pass, and credit card for touch purchases. It's meant so you don't have to bring a wallet. Also they have cups and mugs that have sensors on the bottom, and all drink fountains scan them for refills. It's used for your hotel key if you stay on property. I am sure I am missing things, but that is just a few to mention.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Yup, I'm think you're right. Didn't know it could write to other devices. Very cool 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Flipper doesn't even have WiFi- the worst it could probably do is broadcast a sub-1ghz message for a \~10-20 meter range, so I wouldn't worry about it. 

Also worth mentioning that all of its firmware (and all official software clients) are open source, so if you're really worried you can read through it and see if its doing any funniness. So if you really want to be "safe", build the aforementioned firmware and flash it- but I'm gonna go ahead and assume you'll be fine out of the gates.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Can confirm. I did this as well.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Haven't been in a long time. What's up with NFc's at DW?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
That explains it. Thanks friend!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
The main documentation is in Russian so far
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Need people to start testing this thing out and show the results. I would love to see how well it works. I really don't want this to end up being a bad Kickstarter.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
Wait for the tutorial videos?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
dam, i want mine too. been charged but my address has not been locked yet so guessing shipping still some time off for me.

i was charged start of last year.....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
#4259 here. No idea why I ordered the black one. But stand by my decision to opt in for the devboard. Either black case or dev board will kick you out of the first round of shipments, so that may be why you havent had a shipping notification at this point.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-11
 - I never thought of using my flipper for this. Looks like its time to find some amiibo data.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
'writing' was it waiting for you to present a blank card for it to clone to.  Just like a proxmark etc. You just click emulate to turn the flipper into the rfid card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I think the supported protocols are somewhat limited. (for now)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Same
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I was able to read my keycard for work and store. Will test emulation in the morning.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Well I must be late backing it then. wait I shall.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I have been waiting, hoping they will be generally available sometime soonish.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
There are so many nfc devices at the park, scan everything and try stuff out. It would be a fun experiment.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Been thinking about this for a while, wonder if its possible to identify the nfc character string for the cups and just generate a bunch to keep refilling your drinks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I was told Black wasnt an option
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Yup, I physically have it.  Did an unboxing video earlier today.  Some people were getting it as early as yesterday.  My friend who lives down the road from me hasn't gotten a shipping notification yet, but he was a later backer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
That thing will be fun in Disney world.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
No need you can find dumps for all the amiibo ever made You just gotta download them.

Another similar use is the Savi Workshop LightSabers and Holocron cube/pyramids they  the kyber crystals just have a NFC chip for identification. That is how the lightsaber chooses color or the holocron chooses which recordings to play. You can put in a place holder crystal but hold the the nfc emulation close enough it should be enough to initialize the lightsaber or holocron with the configuration you want. NO more people buying dozens of crystals to get the rare black ones.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Interesting 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Hell no. I just got the hey were shipping soon so confirm your address for the last time. That was like 2 weeks ago. But you got it physically?! What the fuck. I had one backer and then I pre-ordered another. So I figured I would get the kickatarter one by now
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
My roommate created rfid tags for every amiibo just using her phone and some writable paper tags.

Not 100% on the details but she didn't need to have any amiibos to copy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Yes! I'm going to start compiling a master set!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10

1 : 2022-03-10
Glad to hear bricking is a challenge! :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I was a backer.  16,000  Did you get your shipping notification yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Got mine today! I have the orange case as well. Now, to figure out how to use this baby.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
So could you, in theory scan the one you have and send other people the file to emulate on their FZ? :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
The Discord is full of update stories. QFlipper crashed during the update process so my flipper wouldn't turn on. Had to run the repair/update cycle about 7 times but I got it to work. Apparently it's near impossible to brick the flipper so it's good. Glad yours went through without a hitch!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
What the fuck? Where the fuck are my 2 flippers at??! Were you a kickstarter backer or did you pre-order?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
No issues with my update, thankfully.  Wonder if their servers weren't up to par.  What issues did you run into?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I live in Virginia, USA.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Are you using a USB hub or anything?  Perhaps a different PC or USB port?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Anyone run a packet trace to see what the flipper is doing?
See where it phones home to?

I got mine earlier and have an air gapped PC to hook it to.

Is the PC app put on the computer by the flipper?

With everything going on, better to be safe.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Thanks for the reply! 
It did not, unfortunately. Once the PC program tells the flipper to go into the "update and recovery mode", the flipper does go into the mode although the PC program seems to lose connection and eventually times out. =(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
It worked for me once I reformatted the memory card in and through flipper zero. Then through pc app re-updated and all is good hope it helps you
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I'm wondering if mine is doing something similar. When I go to update, it goes into update and recovery mode then just times out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
First thing I did when I got my FlipperZero was to play with NFCs and Amiibos.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Unfortunately no. They have the protected with foil coated cardboard.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Just got mine today! So excited to play with it. The update process was a nightmare but I got it to work.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Should be getting mine tomorrow. I'm stoked!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
This was my thought too. There's a local game shop that has them out in the open. I should probably go take a look at them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I wonder if I could go to Target, Walmart and start scanning all these amiibo
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Where do you live???!!?? What country!!)?!!?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
It'll be a bit I think, though I'd expect production to ramp up now that they've shipped their first decent sized batch. I think they're still working on handling the later Kickstarter orders.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Mate, I can't wait to get mine....
-------------------------------

Congrats!!  Welcome to the club :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
haha,  Gotta love that e-ink screen :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Nice! Thanks for letting us know! Firmware makes me nervous sometimes ;)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Found it with a dead battery and "I'm bored" still on the screen. Poor little guy needs a charge and maybe an update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Figured it out just reformatted drive in flipper then re updated
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I figured it out just ended up reformatting drive in flipper then reupdated and everything works
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
lol right? :D  He's so neglected!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
You can get the qFlipper update application at [https://update.flipp.dev/](https://update.flipp.dev/). Then just plug your device into USB and click the Update button.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
My unit complained about missing databases after I first updated it. To get it working, I needed to install a MicroSD card, format it via Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Format SD Card, and then re-apply the update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Looks so good with the protective case.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
How did you do the update?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Just got my Flipper today as well! Now I just need to figure out what drawer I left my Pwnagotchi in...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Its weird almost as if mine is only partially updating might reset and try again
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Too true.. I want some videos with people using it to hack :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Certainly did!  Mine said the same thing.  I was missing the infrared library but after I updated it was different.  Added the libraries and a few more menu options.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Did your update include any libraries cuz when I updated mine is says the firmware is updated but libraries are missing
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Indeed!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
oh in a few days we'll get flooded with "unboxing" videos
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Ya I havent even gotten my mother fucking kickstarter backer one, and my general pre-order one. So you better get in line OP cause I got djbbs
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
likewise, very very happy with this, can't wait to deep dive after work!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Yes, it was!! :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I was pretty impressed with how solid it was.  Seems very durable, what do you think?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
got mine today, backer #4606
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Sweet! Mine departed York, PA three days ago still nothing (4 hours away).
-------------------------------

1 : 2022-03-10
I have a black and a white in my order, and thus far they have locked my address but I have no shipping information....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
lol.. and it arrived a few hours ago I have it in my hands
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I'm here like "Oh neat, His is coming on SuperMarch64.... --.-- waitaminute"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Yeah that threw me too

but made sense because it fit real nice in the mailbox, add-ons and all 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
wow that box is smaller than I expected
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I forgot I ordered black. My backer number is in the low 3000's so you can imagine my annoyance when I didn't receive a tracking number.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
You should immediate add an SD card, but factory firmware seems to function fine. There are some bug fix release notes for the latest version update though, I played around for a few hours before downloading and updating.

Repo: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
They're still only brushing the surface of shipping their preorders, but they are finally ramping up so it should be in a couple months. 

You can't preorder, but you can sign up on [https://shop.flipperzero.one/](https://shop.flipperzero.one/) for notification when they go on sale again.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
I still havent received mine or any updates 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Niceeeeee
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
No way!?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Black here, no shipping date yet.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
Yeah Im worried, because Im in the states and Im not seeing anything from them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-10
No, no tracking number yet. Only judging from their delivery plans to Europe.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
How do you know when yours is arriving? I paid back in January for my after the deposit total.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Oke, hey... when flip in ZA? Waiting for mine this week in SF. Waiting for next trip home to CPT, too. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
The heck happend to the device?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
IS THERE A STICKER IN THAT BOX?!?

Totally worth the wait!

Actually I'm rather excited but haven't gotten shipping notification yet though, but I did order a black one so....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Got mine today!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Oh I didnt know black is coming out later I got a black one
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
My condolences.. that really sucks.  I was fortunate in that I wasnt even a kickstarter backer but an early preorder who ordered white.  The black ones are going out in later batches.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Yes please!!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
You gotta make a review on that flipper 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Mine should be here tomorrow.. if no one else has, I'll make an unboxing video.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
What is the out of the box functionality software wise? Do we have a code repo up yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Am I the only one getting confused about backerkit. I just checked and apparently this whole time my address wasnt confirmed :/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
White Flippers went out first.

https://blog.flipperzero.one/shipping-going/
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
T-1 day for me. Stoked is an under statement.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Got mine today! Cant wait to play around with it!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Id be willing to pay $200 upfront as a bounty if someone can do this lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09

It is just beautiful, enjoy your time with it mate!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Mine's in a warehouse just a few dozen miles from me... 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Wow
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Its not mine!! But the oke who received is lucky :))
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Wow! You are lucky! I am impatiently waiting for the first unboxing and testing videos. Mine should arrive around April/May unfortunately.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Same here
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Nice. My is coming on MARIO DAY
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Post some pics in the discord if you will, would be nice.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Im just one of those morons who copies and pastes codes and gets annoyed when Arduino or platformio doesnt recognize a new device when I plug it into my mac!! But, Ill post some more pics when it arrives!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Make video's about it please :D
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
Officially turned over to USPS as of yesterday. Tomorrow is the anticipated day
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-09
I had my doubts but, nice 
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-08
Mine arrived at the shipping partner in Illinois and looks to be in transit to USPS now.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-07
Same! lol

1 : 2022-03-07
Oh hey, this is nice.

&gt; Russo-Ukrainian Conflict

&gt; Ongoing conflict doesn't impact our business as Flipper Devices Inc. is a U.S.-based company. Our devices are manufactured in China and shipped from Hong Kong, so logistics is not directly affected too.
-------------------------------

Thought I was being clever ordering one white and one black...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-06
Late march for me. As i ordered feb3
-------------------------------
5 : 2022-03-06
Why did I order black... sigh...
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-06
damn, beat me by 30s
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-06
You should get yours about a month or so before us.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-06
Yes, I'm a us buyer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-06
Are you in the US? I understand the orders were being geographically grouped for shipping. I'm EU so I know that follows.
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-03-06
I've emailed support several times and the last update I got was the bulk shipment arrived from HK a few days ago (Tuesday) and it's up to their 3pl partner to repackage and get individual orders out.

Hopefully by the end of March 2023 we'll start receiving some.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-05
Fap (Im gonna when it finally arrives)
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-05
I saw the same, but if the package hasn't actually been turned over to USPS, that date is meaningless.

That's a good sign. I know the problems are supposed to be handled as the owning entity is US and the delivering entity in HK but it is still concerning.
-------------------------------
5 : 2022-03-04
I got an updated delivery date of 3/10 just a few days ago after getting a tracking number on 2/18, so I'm guessing progress is definitely being made.

Last update was on Feb, 23:

 Has my Flipper already been shipped?

It depends on your country. We are planning to ship all Flippers before the end of March. As soon as you receive a tracking information you can be sure your Flipper is shipped.

 I am a Kickstarter Backer. When will my Flipper ship? We are planning to ship all Flippers before the end of March.

 I am a pre-orderer. When will my Flipper ship? We are planning to ship all Flippers before the end of March.

 Where do you ship from? Hong Kong

 Will the Russian / Ukrainian conflict have impact for the Flipper shipping? No. We ship from Hong Kong.

 Will the Russian / Ukrainian conflict have impact for the company? No. Flipper Devices is a US-based company.

Next update is coming this week:

    I want to make it as detailed and accurate as possible, and it turns out I need more time to gather all the information and ETAs about shipping&amp;manufactory from our Chinese branch office.
    Still hoping to post this week though
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-03
If it helps you, the flippers are being manufactured and shipped from Hong Kong.

Kek.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-03
GAHHH I am so excited!!  
I haven't gotten a tracking number yet. I ordered a black one so it's in the batch being made and prepped for shipping now.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-03
Anyone seeing any real updates. It's getting closer and closer to March 10th and none have appeared on US soil yet. I fear that the 10th will come and go with empty mailboxes.
-------------------------------
8 : 2022-03-03
Preorder codes expired on Feb, 28.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-03
If anyone has a code i'd love to take it off you. I'm willing to pay/donate :) Thanks!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-03
March 10th seems optimistic since USPS is involved.. Fingers crossed either way.. I just hope we dont get overzealous and throw some crazy big sanctions towards China this week and stop all inbound shipments through customs before we get our toys!  
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-03
I know, but I want to have a bank of them on the flipper and emulate the whole tag.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
You can do that with an iPhone and some cheap tags off Amazon
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
White US "shipped" about 2 weeks ago.  Still nothing.   The only scan that comes up on my tracking info is in TN by a "USPS shipping partner."
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Ok, wasnt sure.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-02
No, but they vary in shipping I am finding out. Whites are going out first.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Don't feel so unfortunate. I have an extremely low order number, but they are shipping white first. So, I don't have one.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Damn I'm only backer 17,000. 

Guess I'll wait a bit longer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Why is it unfortunate? Do the different colors vary in hardware?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
27XXX backer black with dev board but I havent heard anything yet:(
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-02
I have a white one, live in U.S. and my backer number is 23XXX. Just got my notification today.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Good to see that shipping is actually happening. I'm backer #13XXX and Im excited to receive mine.
-------------------------------
4 : 2022-03-02
They're all shipping from Hong Kong.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Same delivery date for me!
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-03-02
Same, I wasnt sure if these were gonna make it out.
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-03-02
For real this time? My order has been *"Your order #XXXXXX has been prepared!"* status for close to 2 weeks.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
If you click through to the usps tracking they still haven't received it yet. March 10 is expected arrival in TN?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
Yes I unfortunately didn't have the option for black. I will definitely end up customizing the case somehow.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-02
White, Eastern US, backer # I think is 14XX
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-02
Same!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
amazing considering what's happening in the world right now!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
White one FYI
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
Mine says the same thing, March 10. I'm in USA and my backer number is #14XXX
-------------------------------
4 : 2022-03-01
Woooo! Mine too!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
Expected delivery Thursday March 10th!
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-01
did you order a white one?
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-01
Color? Country? Backer number? Thanks!
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-01
Oh my God I am waiting since 2020 for this to happen, got an email saying it's gonna ship soon but no tracking. This is probably the longest I have waited for a Kickstarter vapor ware ever.......

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
Okay found some detail..
Flipper sources from Hong Kong
The FAQ here : https://blog.flipperzero.one/explaining-shipping-and-taxes/

It mentions the global providers blog here and they've only stopped shipments TO Russia and Ukraine:

https://www.easyship.com/blog
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-01
US yes and was 1-2 weeks
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
Yeah thats my interpretation but that its enroute from overseas still. Those USPS numbers placeholders for when they enter the US delivery system.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
I have the same also.  My interpretation of this is basically "a tracking number was generated however no device has been mailed yet.. ex it's sitting in a warehouse somewhere pending being carried out the door to USPS delivery truck but very clearly not yet in USPS possession"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-03-01
Just got an update this morning that the courier has the package. Estimated arrival date of March 10th given as well.
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-03-01
I've been confused by that too. Any shipping status is better than none, though, given the political climate.
-------------------------------
4 : 2022-03-01
Pre-order codes have expired on February 28th. There is no way to buy Flipper Zero right now. Stay tuned and don't miss live sales that are coming soon.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-28
Where do I enter it?

Only thing I can guess is they are waiting for the large shipment still to arrive from Hong Kong and the tracking numbers are just reserved pending that arrival. Must be coming by ship? IDK

It perplexes me why people become so impatient with the flipper. The question of when we will get them has been asked many times over along with their responses, the company has a blog with some updates. They are doing their best as we all know already. We will get them when we get them. Simple as that. Have patience I say. I imagine OP has placed his order already and has an email with the current status of his shipment, although I may be mistaken.

Why tho? The question fits perfectly in this sub and you don't know OPs priorities or involvement. With that logic, nobody should post any questions in any sub until the war is over. It is perfectly fine and understandable if this is not your concern right now, but I find it a bit silly to get upset when other users still use this sub for legit questions.
-------------------------------

No shipping updates yet. I've only received the same message you have.

Yea, their shipping infographic shows exports out of Asia.  I am just wondering if I'll get it at all now.  I am not mixing the team up with generalizations or anything beyond the product they are offering - I follow the team on socials, they seem like decent people to me.

question Where do you ship from?
Hong Kong

question Will the Russian / Ukrainian conflict have impact for the Flipper shipping?
No. We ship from Hong Kong.

question Will the Russian / Ukrainian conflict have impact for the company?
No. Flipper Devices is a US-based company.

I didn't even think of this. And personally, I'll wait. Unfortunately the nice Flipper People live in a place that's run by a bad guy (don't know what words could get me banned from this sub so keeping it PG). Hopefully all this stops. I've seen so many heart breaking videos from Ukraine.

From wikipedia:

&gt; It became popular among writers in the industry as a way to describe products they felt took too long to be released. InfoWorld magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize it by lampooning Bill Gates with a Golden Vaporware award for the late release of his company's first version of Windows in 1985.

Ouch, one of the earliest usages and it's literally for a **LATE** version of Windows.

I'm implying not having a garage door opener in my car at all times, but just carrying my flipper on my person as my opener. This way no one could steal the opener out of my car, therefore having access to my garage. This has nothing to do with the NFC tags making my garage door opener more secure, but the fact that I'm no longer susceptible to someone essentially stealing my key to my garage. I'm familiar with SDRs and how easily replay attacks can be performed on a lot of older garage openers, I believe mine uses rolling codes so I doubt I will be able to get it working properly but it sounds like a fun project to dig into.

To add to my older response, if you can replicate it consistently, your garage door has a static code which can be easily bruteforced, you should look into a more modern opener.

In our office, there is an old safe with an something that looks like an iButton lock. It was found in a professor's office after he left on bad terms. Nobody know's what's in it, but I think that'll be the first thing I do.

I also want to make some 'smart lights' and control them wirelessly, but I don't want to further saturate in the 2.4GHz range with Bluetooth or Zigbee. I have the lights already. I think this would be a fun flipper project.

Other than that, taking it with me and seeing what I pick up.

I notice you completely avoid my actual point. The definition of vaporware. Other than youre literally fucking idiotic uh its vapor poof durr we all agree vapor means never existed Im delusional hurrr durr definition. You provide no counter definition that doesnt acknowledge vaporware can eventually be delivered and that doesnt retroactively change what it was in the past. Completing software isnt a time traveling device. If it was vaporware couldnt exist because maybe eventually someone picks it up and finishes it. Your definition is shit and you cant source it.

&gt; Very big of you.

This is exactly what the variety of lovers said to me last night during my fifth victory parade!

I spoke to Victoria Aporware, the leading expert on vaporware. She told me that it refers to a product that doesn't really exist. Either they're scamming people, trying to undercut competition, or were just overly ambitious to the point where they can't complete the project. "You pull back the curtains and poof, it's just vapor," she said.

Crowdfunded projects are late. Projects that are being produced during chip shortages are even later. These are valid things to criticize and explore, but aren't vaporware. Especially so since *payments weren't collected until after you made this post*. 

Well, that settles that! A confirmed consultation with the leading expert on vaporware.

If you need me, an alien species has arrived on Earth to study my overwhelming success and see how it can be applied to their own civilizations.

Hey, sorry for this late reply, I just got back from drinking a lot of wine and having a lot of sex during my victory party. I had to rearrange my shelves to put down all my heavy medals made from precious metals. 

I addressed all of your points in my previous comments.  [Please reread the thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/l21q04/flipper_zero_finally_reveals_vaporware_status/hxm4wob/) and then get back to me! Thanks in advance.

From wikipedia you just posted but didn't actually bother reading: In the computer industry, vaporware (or vapourware) is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public **but is late** or never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled. 

oftware or hardware that has been advertised but is **not yet available to buy**, either because it is only a concept or because it is still being written or designed.

It's not obtuse reading it's actually fucking reading. I won't even bother with the logical insanity of if I'm the only one saying it I must be wrong.

&gt; Don't fucking chicken out now you fucking coward.

Hey, I'm being brave and facing my greatest fear in life: Arguing with you on the internet. So if you want to kiss a little, make out, you can just ask. It's fine. If you need me, I'll be polishing my very large and ornate gold trophy I got for winning this argument.

&gt; You tried to find some other definition and couldn't.

Your definition is plenty for me to win. The censers of victory thicken the air and I drink of their aromas.

&gt; Vaporware doesn't mean never it means not when they said.

By an extremely obtuse reading of a dictionary definition that includes "anything that is late"? What does that leave that *isn't* vaporware?

&gt;  You tried to find some other definition and couldn't.

Where? I was going with your definition. There's plenty of others. We can use [the wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware) and the related [list of vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vaporware).

The drapes of success are pulling me in, so I'll keep the rest of my comment short. This is releasing on a normal pace for a kickstarter project that got hit by covid supply shortages. [You are the only person I can find on the internet calling this vaporware](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22flipper%20zero%22%20%22vaporware%22). Unless these never ship for some reason, there is no informed take where this product falls under vaporware.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-20
No No No, I just posted the definition and we all read it. Don't fucking chicken out now you fucking coward. You tried to find some other definition and couldn't. Vaporware doesn't mean never it means not when they said. It's a way to prevent other products from receiving attention and support while you pull your head out of your ass and try to back up your bullshit.

Yes? I'm sorry did you forget which side of the argument you're on?

In Dec2020/Jan2021, at the point they were supposed to start shipping units, they revealed they still had massive amounts of software and hardware design left to do. So it's vaporware at that point in time. Learn to read newb.

How is it any more secure? I think you're mistaken.
The use of Flipper or NFC tags won't do a single good thing for you if your garage door opener is controllable through your flipper that easily, it means your system is using a static code to authorize your garage door, any nerd with an SDR and an arduino with a CC1101 module could open your garage door.
Or just a HackRF, same difficulty.

Sounds to me you have a lot to learn about security.

&gt; You do realize that says theyll all be shipped by August 2021? A year late.

Yeah, this is a valid point of critique! But let's keep the goalposts where they are: **Vaporware status.**

&gt; I didnt get dunked on I got vindicated

Remember, this needs to be *vaporware* for you to be vindicated. Delayed isn't enough.

Kickstarters get delayed all the time by overambitious developers without the experience to scale, and that's multiplied by pandemic influences (especially chip shortages.) There's a lot to criticize them on for failing to meet schedule. But we're talking about *vaporware status*.

And failure to meet schedule does not vaporware make. 

&gt; unless youve got yours in your hand 

I mean, sure, the [frequent blog updates](https://blog.flipperzero.one/) with photos from production, and the shipping updates, and [the publicly available firmware source code](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware) could all be part of an elaborate hoax, I guess?

But really, all signs point to these coming.

Everything they said before that diagram about delivery dates was a lie and so was that and so were the next 3 guesses before they figured out they dont know what theyre doing and just posted pictures of boxes and let people assume the best. Its still shipping any day ramping up production any day unless you like ordered the cool black one or a WiFi board or youre in one of the countries we wont say which that arent getting one yet.

:/ that sucks. But hey, on the upside this project is actually rolling out. Slowly but at least it's moving.

Oh I think it's an old reddit thing then, I orignally did have the wrong email in the comment but edited it several hours before your comment. It was working fine both on desktop (new) reddit and on my phone so I'm assuming it's an old reddit issue :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-18
with your most recent edit it looks fine, when i posted the comment it was broken up in 2 or 3 broken links, one of them being support@flipper.com or something like that.

I'm on old reddit if that matters.

while it still isn't fully interpreted in old reddit at least the it's still using a single address, so it's still usable: https://i.imgur.com/YKiZ4G9.png

Here is the status of my tracking code:

&gt;Picked Up by Shipping Partner, USPS Awaiting Item. Your item was picked up by a shipping partner at 5:06 pm on February 17, 2022 in SMYRNA, TN 37167. This does not indicate receipt by the USPS or the actual mailing date.

This is all good news. Maybe they used FexEx for the drop ship from China. It might take just a few days after the USPS gets it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-18
I ordered three protoboards that are designed to match the flipper interface pins. I received a tracking code so those boards must be ready to ship.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-18
Are we sure they are USPS tracking codes?
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-02-18
Very excited. Does anyone know where they are shipping from? Are they all coming in from China. My tracking code doesn't show anything yet. It could take up to a month if it is being shipped from China.
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-02-18
I have a usps tracking number. Im pretty sure it will ship soon bub.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-18
I just got my email this morning too! I am so excited!

Im not sure what you mean, [thats the address that i linked?](https://imgur.com/a/VZESIcl)

your attempt to reference an email address has gone terribly wrong.

you probably meant to refer to support@flipperdevices.com which is linked at https://flipperzero.one/contacts

If there's nothing in your spam folder, please send an email to [support@flipper.com](mailto:support@flipper.com) so that your order status can be looked up by email address!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-18
Are you US based? Asking to understand if thats still from the end January s batch
-------------------------------
4 : 2022-02-18
Your order should be shipped within the next two weeks :)
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-02-18
Makes sense. I had to wait until feb to use my code.. so ill be on the next batch
-------------------------------
5 : 2022-02-18
Then join flipper discord and ask Anna from
Staff !! She will look at that issue for you. But do it quickly.

F to all haters who said flipper is fake they will never ship

I was told preorders will be shipped Q1 of 2022. Its almost time!!!
-------------------------------
3 : 2022-02-18
got mine today too (=

5 : 2022-02-18
Did anyone get a confirmation email after finalizing their pre-order? I did not and I'm thinking my order was stopped.

Me too but havent gotten that email yet
-------------------------------

Playing with the NFC, editing Amiibo user data, etc. Also if I can find some conclusive information about Zigbee/Z-Wave capability I'd love to mess with that too.

Yay!!! Got one too. Congrats!
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-02-17
Anyone have a code theyre willing to give away?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
I think my main usage will probably be related to that sub-1GHz radio as I didn't have any device that can receive and transmit signals in these frequency in such flexibility. Since I love tinkering with hardware, those GPIOs will probably give me many ideas, too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
I specifically registered here as I am our only place that sells Flipper Zero coupons. I have one left for one device. If you don't need it, then ok.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
Not to mention much more secure than running a typical remote that someone could potentially steal, therefore having access to my garage! Keep me posted on your IR idea, could possibly help me implement my idea. Seems like making a sort of NFC shortcut to ANY of the other functionalities would be worth figuring out.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
This is a neat idea and doesn't seem too hard to implement. 

I may create some NFC tags to configure the flipper into an IR remote. Stick it on my nightstand to control my bedroom TV.
-------------------------------
5 : 2022-02-17
I have an idea for using the NFC capability to transmit a specific stored frequency, like say a garage door. Then I can just keep an NFC tag in my car and tap my flipper against it to open up my garage. Not sure how to even go about it, but considering its open-source, it should be doable
-------------------------------
2 : 2022-02-17
No, cars use something called a rolling code, you could in theory do it given you know the algorithm and master key used.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
1 Karma, fresh account, no other posts... you know what I mean, don't you?
-------------------------------
5 : 2022-02-17
Ooooh, neat idea! See if it can do some sort of triangulation if the user circles around a possible source. Kind of like Wigle does for direction finding.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-17
Could you also perhaps reprogram your car to use a "non-factory standard" frequency and then use your Flipper as a keyfob instead?

Would this leave your vehicle even more vulnerable?
-------------------------------
6 : 2022-02-17
I wonder if one could created a live map of the radio signals Flipper picks up on. Plot out the signals based on distance and signal strength.
-------------------------------
6 : 2022-02-17
Clearly take over the world! But mainly learn more and explore frequencies and expand my adhd brain with more random skills and knowledge.
-------------------------------
10 : 2022-02-17
I work in vehicle security so it could prove a good tool for the varying wireless frequencies and protocols employed by all the manufacturers.
It'll also prove educational when messing with the third-party alarm systems and track&amp;trace units as well, seeing as they use 2 factor authorization in a way.
-------------------------------
15 : 2022-02-17
Good post! I'll hopefully be using mine for 900 mhz and other RFID signal analysis and decoding. Bit of "take it with you where you go and see what's in the airwaves that it can recognize"

you will be notified and your address will be locked shortly before your shipment goes out.  
this allows you to change your shipping address until then.  
from [https://blog.flipperzero.one/shipping-started/](https://blog.flipperzero.one/shipping-started/):  
&gt; You can change your shipping address in your account now and we will warn you before blocking all changes to the shipping addresses. The first warning will come prior to a week, and the last warning two days before locking in the address. After it is locked, changing the address will no longer be possible.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-14
I am in the 3000th backer range, but when I check my address is not locked.  Is there somewhere I need to go to lock this in?  or is it automatic?

1 : 2022-02-14
I, I give away my code:

1 : 2022-02-05
FOMO and childish mentality, people want the cool thing now, even though they missed their chance for an early unit, they'll stomp their feet, beg and plead, as if they don't get bored of the device in a week or two.

I wouldn't be surprised if 80% of the people here never actually used it for any research and just want a shiny toy.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
No.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
You don't evidently hate it enough.
Can't have your toy in the time you want it so you'll throw whatever spine you have to the wayside and join the beggars.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Just wait.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Hey man! I'm sorry you missed out. But that's life, so now you just have to be patient and wait for orders to open up instead of helping flood the subreddit with another begging thread. :)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Fuck off, you're too late, so now you gotta wait like everyone else.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Or you and your kind have to realize that you're being an annoying cunt, you were too late for the pre order, so now you have to wait.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Sounds like a good idea, will try making a pinned post.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Thanks for the info! I also read the news letter and didn't understand.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-05
Yeah it connects to the gpio ports and is an additional add-on board. Most people get the confusion on this. Just an add-on that has the esp32 SoC
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
Community will publish something for sure or I will:)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
I could get behind that. They could even make a pinned thread for all requests or just ban them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
Right, I just meant create and or enforce. Either would be true with their time
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
Its not as if there is a large number of new and unique posts in this sub lol. There are two non-preorder code related posts in the last 10 days.

&amp;nbsp;

 If you want to stop seeing pre-order codes, post original content or ask the mods to change the rules to disallow them.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
Get an arduino and 2 RF modules and an SDR, you don't need Flipper for this.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
I don't see this listed as against the rules anywhere.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
[deleted]
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04

-------------------------------

besides, it doesn't seem that there even are rules
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-04
This. Also the mods are literally Pavel and others who are actually working on Flipper stuff. I dont think they have time to delete redundant posts/enforce rules

Pre-ordered and paid, still waiting
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
Ah. They're not including them in the box yet because of reliability issues.
Yeah, the wifi addon is an external board you attach to the top, those pins are there for people to develop their own add-ons. They even give out casing dimensions so people can design and print fancy cases for their stuff.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
This was my confusion, from the news letter: 

We will hand over the first 5 000 orders to the logistics before the end of January, this batch will be heading to the United States. Were sending only orders with white Flippers without the ESP WiFi board to keep any possible defects from getting out of the factory while we improve the process further.
We will be sending out 20k more by the end of February. And we plan to ship the rest of the orders by the end of March, both Kickstarter and pre-orders from our shop, if all goes smoothly.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
can you link me the letter?
Because having the wifi addon installed implies a complete PCB redesign, redoing manufacturing and testing tooling.
I think you're simply mistaken, they might be included, but they're not internally installed.
They're an external addon board, if you look at the actual images of the Flipper Zero you can see a row of pinsockets.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
Yes. Ill look it up later, but I do believe based on that last news letter that the next big shipment, the one well get, has them installed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
This.
Flipper zero can take an esp32 based wifi addon, possibly the future Flipper One will have wifi on board.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
Pre-ordered and paid already. So far nothing more than order confirmation...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
I believe there's just add-on board available, but no wifi onboard...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-02-01
Wait, there is WiFi on the flipper zero? Must have completely missed that update.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-31
I backed this project a really long time ago. Planning on waiting a bit longer after following the entire process for more than a year.

Hang in there!

Backed and paid via Kickstarter. Nothing yet, but dont plan on getting it this round. Only 5k devices shipped to us and I believe those do not have the wi-fi.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-31
I did the preorder too but I got my email to purchase.  Im still waiting for info on mine

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-31
Go to /r/rtlsdr and have fun on the cheap. The flipper is more for applied rf testing, whereas the rtlsdr can be used to monitor and learn a ton for only $20.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-31
Just use a cheap sdr or something. Youd be able to look at a wider range of signals too.

I thought that the wifi dev board in the shop had already a firmware like you said and it will be working without any programming beceause like Glock2puss said it was in description
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
nice one. no worries mate. hope you enjoy it!

thanks for that mate, have used the code :)

Please comment once used.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
but idk why people act like the flipper won't be capable of deauthing. in the description of the wifi board it literally says deauthing and PKMID is a feature
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
yoo a live chat?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
wifi just too high abstraction level for such device
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
flipper one will be built on some sort of i.MX CPU running Linux, that's where you'll be able to use WiFi with "full power"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
i don't understand why everyone is so horny about WiFi in flipper zero, that version is just not "about that"
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
So you need to start from understanding of architecture of flipper's firmware
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-24
Secondly you'll need to write an application to handle that ESP via API, show information on the screen, interact with buttons etc.

I think that you'll need to program your wifi board (ESP-32) with modified deauth firmware. Also you'll need to put some sort of API to exchange information and commands for ESP.
-------------------------------

Dang it

So still just the orders of the first Kickstarter pre orders
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
First 5k sent to America and then they ramp up production
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
Im still confused I pledged a while ago but havent been on top of the blog at all but this is still the first batch right?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
Looks like the white non wifi units will hit first.

I say quality first. We've waited this long, take your time to get the QC great.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
There have been so many times in these past few years that I've needed it. My garage door controller has been on the fritz for over a year. I almost killed myself trying to get out before it closed. That will be one problem solved once I have that in my pocket. 

There have been a bunch of other stuff, like HID cards. Everything is wireless now. This will be a great tool to have.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
based on https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flipper-devices/flipper-zero-tamagochi-for-hackers/description i count 41,185 as original backers, though the blog post adds to about 55k devices, so that may already include some post-kickstarter preorders i guess
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
5k units so far. How many were sold during the Kickstarter event?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-21
Yes!!
-------------------------------

Yeah its not built in, its an esp-32 dev board that connects to the gpio ports, it was an extra cost

1 : 2022-01-18
I thought they weren't doing a wifi version until original was successful?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-18
I don't remember if I got the wifi version but I did get the black one
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-18
1. Why are you asking me
2. There will be an update this week, as the picture stated

Also someone on here stated they got a shipping notice. Ive heard if you got the black version and or the wifi module it will take a bit longer
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-18
So where is my box???
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-18
Dang, so close!

Im 29,477 in US, got white, but added the st-link-&gt;esp board. Cant wait!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
#15,659 in west coast U.S. Nothing about shipped notification yet. Just waiting like the rest anxiously
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
I'm 5700th and received nothing :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Dang. Missed it because I ordered black.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Oh hell yeah.  Got my email today.  Didn't realize it was limited or potentially really happening soon! Exciting stuff
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Tbh i like the open board look if the wiri module is connected hehe, and also yeah flipper zero is their priority right now, they will work on one when zero is fully finalized
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Yeah, it's an esp-32 so wifi deauth is no big deal.  The board itself seems a little janky, I wonder if there will be a more complete module (maybe with a case?) later.  There was a Flipper One planned, but it's removed from the website apparently.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Order 35,xxx waiting for that email babbbyyyyyy!   
A coworker got one with me so were chomping at the bit! (He also thinks i took his money)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
lucky you ;-)
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Im 10,214, but Im from the UK so the wait continues :(
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Apparently it's US-only for now. Still, progress!
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Nice that US will be shipped very soon. Hope Germany will follow fast  I want to get mine.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Same. I'm around order 2500.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Preemptively saying:

Im located in the United States so that might have something to do with it. Im backer number 30,565 according to my kickstarter pledge.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-17
Interestingly, backerkit email went out today.  There are videos of prototypes in the hands of third parties on YouTube.  I think it's close.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-16
With a lack of an update 3 months later I'd say this at least feels like vaporware. I have already written off my kickstarter contribution as a loss. I honestly don't expect to ever recieve a Flipper Zero at this rate. The whole situation, chip shortage or not, seems very sus
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-14
Patience is a virtue. Also, we will also soon Hack the Planet, esp with them ridiculous LA parking prices per hour.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-14
wen ship.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-14
What a mess, so nothing has been shipped yet and they just hired someone for the documentation now. Can't believe what a chaos this is. Quick Tip, hire also someone to do the packaging and shipping....
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-14
wen flip
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-13
Seriously due for an update, it's getting a bit silly now.

&gt;Sorry for leaving you for so long. Im currently busy setting up logistics and working on a software that collects electronics testing reports from the factory. So happy to finally see them coming in real time, our QA team have developed great testing tooling, literally every feature of every Flipper is tested and the whole process takes just a few minutes. I didnt know before that electronics manufacturing is that serious open_mouth This + one year warranty ensures your devices will be stable and fully functional.

We have also just hired a special person to handle all our docs, so all Flipper features and SDKs will be documented well in English and Russian soon. 

As for communications, Agatha is currently the only person who is dealing with hundreds tickets and questions that piled up during our national holidays (31 Dec - 10 Jan). All your tickets will finally get answers, she is doing great.

However, some questions that were asked here during these days might get lost, so if you have problems with your orders, its best to ask via Kickstarter PM or support@flipperdevices.com. 

Thank you so much for your patience, we are finally close to the end of this long waiting journey and will be happy to concentrate on Flipper One development after that


This is what Anna pinned today. So it looks like they are still busy testing every flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-13
Anna made a pinned update about shipping yesterday in discord
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-13
I just jumped into this subreddit in hopes of an update.  I haven't received one myself.  Wonder if Omicron is slowing things down further.

You can fork this exploit and it on a Flipper
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-12
I'm just hoping to get the thing at this point... Where are they?!
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-11
Thats a bummer.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-11
My understanding is they are sending emails to people with codes, i.e. we need an email with a link to even use that code.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-10
dude this isnt a big operation, there is a massive issue with manufacturing and shipping these types of devices everywhere
-------------------------------

[removed]
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-09
I remember reading recently (probably on the blog) that they wanted to amass a significant portion of the orders for each country to optimize shipping costs. If we're both in the US, we might be waiting a bit until they can fill a conex box, or whatever metric they're using.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-09
I'm in the same boat bro, I backed like month one of the kickstarter, i have faith, seeing that they are being shipped in russia obviously
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-09
I would really like to see the one I ordered two years ago in my room ... pretty sure it will never arrive
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-06
Haha yeah it's a bit like that, but in all honesty they have nothing to tell us. All they could show would be a manufacturing line with people putting parts together, which isn't really worthy news. They gave a very detailed explanation in their November update which explained all of this, including an increase in production over the course of these 2 months. I'd suggest having a re read of it, just to reassure yourself.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-06
I agree with your line of thinking, I ordered over a year ago and was okay with waiting. Its just been radio silence for the past 2 months and I was starting to get a bit worried that I either missed a vital bit of info or they just went rogue
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-06
We will most likely get an update when mass shipping begins. They have been very open about everything, all the way down to the injection molds they use to make the case, so I doubt they won't ship.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-06
Nah I was just googling and browsing my email just incase I missed something
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-06
Great! So I should be expecting it at the end of the monthI hope

-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-05
I have one too! Pm me for it.

1 : 2022-01-05
Sold?

1 : 2022-01-04
Do you still have it? What are you asking for in trade or $$$ ?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-04
Oh I'm interested. I missed out on the kickstarter like way back.   
Wife may kill me for getting another gadget though...
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-04
are you in the discord?
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-04
I'm waiting impatiently for mine, but would love one sooner if you're giving your pre-order spot away
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-03
Similar case here; I doubt I'll *need* but I'm curious about stuff like this so I figured why not, it's interesting.

There is a chat in Telegram, its in Russian. But probably your best shot

I'm going in with little-to-0 expectations, but the possibility for this is why I got it. 

Getting to play with the firmware sounds good too though.
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-03
I just went ahead and bought it lol, altough i'm not planning to code and stuff, but i read somewhere you will be able to deauth wifi networks with it, which would be awesome
-------------------------------
1 : 2022-01-03
Only if you plan on modding the firmware a lot

The debug features are really useful for the development, but if you're just going to use the device without much coding for it - you won't miss out on anything

So, I would say that if you ask that question, you probably don't need it

Yep, we've sent out a few invites to complete the pre-orders. 
After we evict all the bugs from the shop we'll send out the rest of the invite emails.

INITIAL MESSAGE
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Regarding some of the negative feedback, the team has been providing regular updates and explanations about the design and manufacturing process. Its a brand new product, what did you expect?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Humans are going to have advanced beyond using radio waves by the time we get a Flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
They seem to do progress updates monthly.  Hoping for a Christmas miracle, but expecting to see the device sometime Q1 2022 in reality.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Still waiting on the email for mine
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I feel that
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Yea im not too worried about not getting it. Theyve done a good job updating backers as well as still continuing manufacturing with a global chip shortage. I just want mine before new site orders
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I was mad at first about the delays but seeing how the tackled every obstacle so far, we are lucky this thing isnt vapourware at this point
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Yea I can't imagine they would send out new site orders before backers but who fuckin knows these days
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Im hoping an update is in the pipeline and these emails have snuck out early. Ive got faith they wouldnt put their backers to the back of the line, hopeful to receive it January. Im moving house soon so its a bit worrying
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I have already forgotten twice that I already ordered it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I'm wondering the same. I havent received any email concerning a shipping update
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I thought I paid already via Kickstarter wonder if this is good news for backers
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
 stoked as well got 2 on order with a silcone case and a wifi adapter
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
Just emailed them and its not a spoof
Only a few invites have been sent out and when they work out all the bugs in the Shop they will send out a mass email .
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-17
I ordered mine 2yrs ago and still nothing

-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-09
Was only in acoma for a week lol
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-12-09
Well then you wouldnt have missed much and the age of this post wouldnt in any way be relevant. Now if you were in a coma until last week, and capable of expressing thoughts through text, well then maybe that would be the first half of an uninteresting thing you just said.

Yours would be shipped first Id guess, this is just the stragglers getting in line next.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-27
Wish I'd knew about the Kickstarter campaign back then...

First time I heard about flipper, it was just over...
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-27
The hyped is unmeasurable, i took the plunge a full 2 years ago when i saw that phenomenal kickstarter video
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-26
Where do you see accessories s ?
-------------------------------
6 : 2021-11-26
I dont think they are. I could be totally off here but Id imagine flipper is opening the rest of the order process for those who have not yet had the opportunity to place the full order. Ive been fully paid and accessories chosen since April as well
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-26
Im hyped for this too, but I didnt get any notification like this. Im fully paid (except for shipping). How come you crazy nuggets are getting the Flipper first?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-26
Man, I've been hyped for this for so long
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-18
22 very in-depth blog post updates that explain how they're making do with the global chip shortage that toppled just about every industry, tons of regular people outside of the company helping the development of software, countless photo and video documentation, purchase orders from component manufacturers (seen above), an event held in Russia showcasing the device (Flipper Nights), verifiable certifications, patents filed, trademarks filed, lots of high-quality artwork developed for everything they have shared on the internet, projected production and shipment dates (yes when a company says they plan to ship something that is ALWAYS subject to change, especially on Kickstarter. How did you not know this going into it?). Yet you somehow still think this is a scam? If they're committing this much to an elaborate scam I'm impressed. Anyone trying to sell a fake product would have cut and run by now. Just because they already have your money you feel more invested than anyone else that may have recently discovered this device, think those people think its a scam? I'd bet not. Just calm down and stop calling these guys out as scammers, they are pouring so much time, effort, and money ( yes it is crowdfunded, but that's the point, WE PAID to help development) and they are doing an incredible job given the circumstances of starting a tech company in the middle of a global crisis.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-15
&gt; We have 60000 screens, enough for all the devices backed on Kickstarter and for some part of the pre-orders made on our website.

I would guess late January/early February
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-15
When can preorders be expected to be available?
-------------------------------
7 : 2021-11-15
Yes!

&gt;	Shipments to backers will begin in December. Due to the complexity of logistics, we need to accumulate a certain volume of parcels for import to each specific country. This is due to the limitations imposed by the logistics broker. We expect to ship most of the backer orders by the end of January.
-------------------------------
10 : 2021-11-15
Can... can we get excited yet? I need somebody else to confirm that I can get excited. The patience toggle is broken in the on position.

Alex, what is jumping to conclusions based on overlooking information right in front of me?


Put your pitchfork down and do a charge back with your bank. I feel bad for the company. No matter how transparent they are, they cannot possibly spoon feed it small enough to stop people like yourself from generating misinformation.
-------------------------------
3 : 2021-11-15
This comment shows your inability to read for comprehension. Are you trying to translate the original Russian posts yourself? Lies? Strange developer? Save your deep state conspiracies for politics. Did you hear about a little thing called the global effing chip shortage? I will be surprised if you know how to turn on your device. Which is scheduled to be shipped between December and the end of January if your a KS backer. This device is not for luddites. I'll give you $50 for yours, after it's in your hands, Im confident you will claim it's broken or defective instead of admitting you have no idea.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-13
So on a positive note..... even if Flipper Zero was a scam and some of us are going to take an L. If that little bastard device can have that many capabilities packed into it then surely one of our unsung hacking heroes will build one. Or maybe Hak5 will make the damn thing and charge us $599.99 for the fucker. lol.
-------------------------------

Good news everyone! We finally got LCD screens. This means that we have all the necessary components to start mass production of Flippers. We now have 60k screens, which is enough to produce the Flippers ordered by backers on Kickstarter, as well as some of the pre-orders made on our website. Inside the story of what we have been doing all this time, as well as the plan for production and delivery.  


The production line is currently producing \~ 150 devices per week, but within a few weeks we will be increasing the capacity to produce several thousand devices per week. Learn more about the production plan and projected delivery at the end of the pos

&amp;#x200B;

While we waited for components to be manufactured, development was actively continued. Every day, changes are made to Flipper's firmware, bugs are fixed and new features are added. You can follow the log of commits to the firmware in our GitHub repository .

&amp;#x200B;

A team of more than 30 people is working on Flipper full time . A lot of work has already been done, and much is still ahead.  
  
Over 90k lines of code written  
More than 2000 issues closed in Jira  
85% of Flipper's declared features have already been implemented  
The first prototypes of mobile applications for Android and iOS were written  
The desktop application qFlipper under Windows / macOS / Linux is written  
More than 60 alternatives were selected and tested for 20 hard-to-find components (IT WAS VERY PAINFUL)
-------------------------------

The most important part I got from translate: 

Shipping for backers starts in December, and they expect most backer units will ship by the end of January.
-------------------------------
3 : 2021-11-12
According to translate, they've got the screens in and can finally start mass production.

LETS GOOOO

Would love a flipper diy though!

yeah , im a long time viewer of N-O-D-E , I really love his designs and engineering, especially those pi handhelds and f91-w mods
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-11
These are gonna be so cool! cant wait to see when they start shipping
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-11
Node is a hardware hacker that designs open source pi portables.

Super cool, and you can DIY, but not really the same thing as flipper.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-11
Over two years waiting on a device ... FML ... pretty sure this is  a scam
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-09
I don't understand why is everyone so calm about this and everywhere someone is talking about how "great communication" this developers have.
I assume that I've scammed and I'll never receive the device. First they changed the original date because they "forgot" about a lot of things, I call that lying.
And now they post in October that they are getting the parts soon and start delivering and then no update till November.
Now the only update is a tweet showing the screens but no official news on their portal.
I don't like the fact that this is a strange Russian developer and I also think that they have an army of people posting stuff everywhere and saying great things about a company that have been sitting on my money for so long...
Assume it, you lost your money
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-06
This is the very last component they actually need to start mass production. Their next update will be that they've started production. Pre-orders will be shipped out shortly after that, and they'll most likely provide a date on which everyone else can start ordering.

Here's the catch. I'm willing to bet money that they will run out of parts once they open ordering to the public, so there will be an initial buying period followed by out of stock period, but hopefully the latter won't last too long...
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-03
lol I have to share this with somebody I choose you =P

Looking at the CEO's [most recent comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/oo7kws/multitool_device_for_hackers_flipper_zero_started/h5zr76f/?context=3) on reddit

I like that passion! YES TELL US! WITH LINKS AND PRICES! SHOW US YOUR MULTI-TOOL! lol I appreciate that attitude.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-03
Which yeah, I totally get. 

I really can't knock them at all. They seem like a really cool group, and I wish I spoke Russian.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-03
I doubt they'll shit it this year.  It's a shame, because the small / niche hardware market was really taking off and people were making some really cool stuff, but if the big players can't get their chips, seems there's almost no hope for the little guys.
-------------------------------
4 : 2021-11-03
&gt; though it seems updates lately have been a bit slow maybe. 

Agreed, though I assumed they were taking a 'we'll let you know when we have something new to report, we haven't said anything lately because we have nothing new to add.' type of attitude
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-11-03
I completely understand the delay with all the shortages. I'm in IT and even ordering monitors is getting annoying. 
However, I'm also not a patient person. So while I understand and respect the Flipper people for what they are doing. I kind of gave up hope on it. Hopefully I'll be proven wrong. It is such a cool thing.
-------------------------------
7 : 2021-11-03
I guess I feel pretty much the same. 

Yeah I'm bummed that I don't have it yet, but I kinda expected issues on a preorder Kickstarter kinda deal. Slap a shit show pandemic on it and I think we're looking at best case scenario really. 

Transparency and quality of updates have been great through the whole process, though it seems updates lately have been a bit slow maybe. 

I'm looking forward to the official word and update! I'm not mad at em yet. As long as I get it and it works half as well as shown so far I'll be pleased.
-------------------------------
21 : 2021-11-03
lol at Jakub's spicy take there. 

Real Talk: I'm also annoyed I don't have my flipper yet... but I feel rather silly bitching about it considering what I know about the pandemics effect on sourcing electronic components. I bought a gad damn pre-built computer this year! Something 16 year old me would be ashamed of. 

I've read that car companies have cars all ready to go save their electronics and they are just sitting on the production floor waiting.

I feel the flipper team have been really transparent with the whole process.
-------------------------------
4 : 2021-11-03
That's fantastic news. Supposedly that was the only part delaying mass production. Let's wait and see.

Bro let's worry about the zero for now we can't even get that one....the one if anything will be the improved version maybe another 4years
-------------------------------
4 : 2021-11-01
We got email from them on October 25th explaining this exact line item not being available, and what they are replacing it with.

The `STLINK-V3MODS`, which was only for the Devboard, is being replaced with an ESP32 board that can be used as a programmer, and has Wifi.

Maybe only people who ordered this devboard got the email, but they explicitly say that they have replaced that part so that we wouldn't have to wait until June 2023, because that would be ridiculous.

They've also stated that they'll be on the look out for other sources when applicable. Or similar components when available/compatible. Just hold your horses. Prepared for the worst,  sure. But, hope for the best.
-------------------------------
17 : 2021-11-01
I have a feeling things will be better or a solution will be found before then. The Flipper people had been doing a fantastic job in showing the process for how they were making their product before the global supply chain fell apart. If they really didn't think they would be putting out a product for another year I have a feeling they would say so or announce product changes. If my local supermarket can't keep string cheese and juice boxes in stock I can't imagine what it must be like to source specialized components right now. I can be patient.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-10-31
Also I think it's a scam.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-10-30
Any new updates?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-10-29
We're pushing into November soon... I know some problems are reasonable, but when each promise of progress doesn't pan out time after time, it's not a good look. 

We are nearing the end of fall, has ANYONE gotten anything physical?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-10-14
Considering it's all open source and has gpio I imagine you could get crafty and make your own version in a different form factor.

Yeah I'm a backer and don't have mine. They're prepared to ramp up production just waiting on components, mainly screens if I recall correctly

According to what I've read, pre-orders are closed as well. Due to the chip crisis, even Kickstarter backers don't have their flipper.

Nope, just the tamagotchi style.

2 : 2021-09-08
Thanks for the update, I was getting impatient again.
-------------------------------
7 : 2021-09-08
The level of transparency is what I wish every company did. Patiently waiting for the team to receive and begin mass producing. Definitely going to need to learn how to use this for all the reasons I want; in particular NFC cloning and a few other minor things.

The m5stickc+ is what is pictured above

I have some other sketches for it that include acting as an IR remote, setting the time, and exploiting the Wi-Fi beacon packets to make it appear that the m5stickc+ is broadcasting 20 amusingly named Wi-Fi AP's
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-09-06
Does anyone else have this m5stickc? I'm pretty excited about trying to gpio some functions into the flipper.


What success has anybody had with m5stickc+ use?

U2F may prove to be more more difficult because of MCU peculiarities.   
If I understood correctly, there is a separate core that's used for private keys and such, and it has some hard to work with proprietary firmware.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-08-09
The battery is sandwiched between two PCBs, and increasing capacity by increasing size while still keeping it in the original case wouldn't work.   


Your best bet is to use a power bank, or if you're already carrying a laptop you can use it to charge Flipper as well.

I like how I'm supposed to be okay with waiting for product delivery. This is fine.

I hope this isn't the case. I really hope that isn't so.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-08-05
Maybe they will continue to whack features away promised in this model to re sell them in the next model.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-08-05
I'm really starting to think it's just a scam and that the shipping was just an extra cash grab. One would have expected that the components would have been secured at the first delayed shipping date in February. There are quite a number of other concerning red flags.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-08-05
true, but I lug enough around as is, a bigger battery would serve my wants better.  Of course I wont complain if there isnt a better battery, just want to know if there is a higher cap battery or enough space for a bigger one
-------------------------------
4 : 2021-08-05
Well since it has usb-c I would suggest just buy powerbank and then you have no worries your flipper or any portable device will be out of juice

I don't know why you'd want one. Wait until the mass production units are available else you'll end up with a bunch of bugs and messes.

I agree. Was hoping someone got bored with it and was willing to let it go.

Flipper is looking very lazy in those pics haha.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-06-17
Flipper only supports RFID 125kHz and 13,56MHz. What do you mean by "Long distance RFID"?  If you mean UHF range, Flipper doesn't support it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-06-17
As far as I understand, the flipper zero will have an SDR which could be capable of radio 'replay attacks'; however, with radio signals used for security, a lot of them have extra security features where the radio message is concerned. For example, car keys use an encrypted rolling code which changes every time and only the car knows what that next code will be. It all depends on how secure the system is that you're intending to use it on.

In terms of range, I think you will have to get very close to whatever you're transmitting to. I have a HackRF One and have experimented with this stuff a little bit and even that requires you to be very close to what you're transmitting to, so I really doubt that the flipper zero will have an amazing range.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-06-17
Its uhf rfid window tags. I think it has different frequencies based on which type of tag you use. Looks like 125kHz or 902-928 MHz from what I see in this site. 

https://www.gatedepot.com/access-control/vehicle-access-control
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-06-17
Long distance RFID? What do you mean by this? Are you referring to \~433MHZ radio transmission?

Please do make a statement and please make sure everyone gets it. I spent quite a lot of time trying to find out what this was this morning, and the only information was on this Reddit discussion. We were worried about this. Fortunately we didn't get to the point of reporting it to the card issuer, in the UK they can cancel cards at the drop of a hat.

The lot is kind of weird. Its small, maybe 16 cars only and at the time there were only 3 cars in it. I think it may be the private parking for employees of the building, I'm not sure. As I mentioned to another reader, I tried several times to open the gate by driving up to it and nothing happened.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-28
I tried several times to drive up to the gate and it wouldn't open.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-04-28
They wouldn't be able to leave at all without the Flipper Zero.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-28
Oh, we are in agreement that there was a loop sensor at the gate.

Just found the image of 400 people jumping into their cars to escape a burning building single-file through a lone parking lot exit amusing.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-28
Perhaps they could leave on foot?
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-04-28
It sounds to me that you panicked without first trying to exit with your vehicle. The gates are designed to keep people out, not to keep people in. It would be a very costly breach of building code to not install an inexpensive sensor for egress. Imagine what 400 apartment residents would do if there were a building fire and people weren't able to freely exit.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-04-28
I'm surprised that the gate was secured on the exit side, usually there's a buried loop of cable in front of the gate that will sense a large mass of metal over it and trigger the gate open.
-------------------------------

1 : 2021-04-27
Not op, but yeah it's technically whom. "I" is the subject, the one doing the "contact"ing. And "whom" is the object--the one being "contact"ed. 

There doesn't need to be a preposition before a pronoun for it to be an object. Just think of who is performing the action, and upon whom the action is being performed.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-27
Thank you all for the replies. That actually helps a lot. Thank you.

Join the Discord channel if you want better updates. Check the faq first before asking, but there has been an issue with Stripe processing payments for shipping and there might be further delays.

Thanks! I was literally calling my bank to block the creditcard and reverse the transaction, but stumbled on this topic at the last second.
-------------------------------
2 : 2021-04-27
They did charge for shipping early to get it out of the way. They still need to go through the early adopter process and get to mass production.

Thanks for this... couldn't understand it. Appeared as "HEROES CAPITAL Potomac MD" on my card.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-16
its fine, not the end of the world, is it time urgent to make the payment or can it wait until my new card arrives?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-16
From an IT security perspective even one case is 100% more than it should be. Yet I made zero claims, only questions and assumptions.

Thanks for the advice, mate, but no worries, it was exactly a credit card. Money is not the issue here, unexpected active card permanent blockage is.

And now, after a few other calls with my bank, Im 100% sure that my case caused precisely by the whole situation with excessive fraudulent reports for Heroes Capital. Exactly as Anna explained.

So yeah, still the right place to ask 
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-16
Just from an IT security perspective this still leaves other card gathering methods like magecart style attacks, but claiming a company has this issue based on two people is a long stretch. Plus this project is solid.

Start using credit cards not your own money and even if you get an issue, its refunded straightaway.

(might be good for mods to pin this link for deeper resources.)
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-04-15
I see. Thanks for the response and the explanation.

The transaction itself went fine, yet my bank permanently blocked the card after; thats why I was worried. Sadly, in this case, my bank cant unblock the card, only reissue it. Thats my consequence, I guess 

Yes, I remember now that it was a Stripe-powered form. Zero worries about Stripe. But the merchant being marked as fraudulent extensively may explain it all as well, I suppose.

Our US industrial design company [Design Heroes](https://designheroes.io) has Heroes Capital LLC legal name, which is by tragical coincidence matches that investment fund name.

"... an Arduino in your pocket with a screen and a battery that can run multiple programs." I just ran across this old comment somehow and this resonated with me. This is basically why I backed the Flipper and I'm pretty excited about it. I don't have any delusions that I'll become a badass hacker with the thing, but I love the idea of a good versatile Arduino device with a lot of built in communications/radio components and GPIO.

According to the website 


"How do I buy Flipper Zero?

We had a Kickstarter campaign, but now it's over.
There is no way to buy Flipper Zero now, but it'll be possible when we open pre-orders on our website.
We're planning to do so in February."

I personality wouldn't jump the gun with a February timeline but who knows, don't look like it's been updated in a while.

I note that you, Downtown_Lab_5150, mistyped a comment and could have posted playing with ~~allot~~ [**a lot**] of the features instead. Allot is a verb; a lot is a noun or adverb.

-------------------------------
1 : 2021-02-09
Yes that is my understanding as well. I was given the opportunity to grab another, or other things like blank board for GPIO pins and a silicone sleeve. I was debating on picking up a 2nd one but didn't for this exact reason. I have found this very common with kickstarters but I still have high hopes. Still, even if a major update comes along, I'm really excited about the possibility of a linux box being on the flipper one, once released. I'll probably just wait out for that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-02-09
Same here!!
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-02-09
I read through the updates and it looks like some early backers can opt in for first batch but it most likely will have factory defects along with some other issues and completely finished, mass produced pieces will be April through august

Would you recommend any of the add ons available e.g. the developer board with st-link v3?

The Flipper Zero is using a variant of the STM32 microcontroller so by default it will be programmed with the C programming language. I would recommend learning more about Arduinos and using the Arduino IDE as the Flipper will be a very similar experience to that.
-------------------------------
3 : 2021-02-02
Im a noob as well who purchased a Flipper. What programming/skills would you recommend focusing on to get a better and wider experience  with the flipper?
-------------------------------
7 : 2021-02-01
Flipper Zero is like a platform. It has a bunch of hardware features that can be expanded upon with software. It has a bunch of built in functionality but with its open source hardware and code it is easy to do whatever you want. For example, out of the box the Flipper Zero can read and emulate NFC tags but it cant write to them. You could design your own circuit that can write to NFC tags. With the GPIO pins on the front you could connect the circuit directly to the Flipper and write to NFC tags with the program that you made. 

In short its a very versatile and hackable tool that you can use for anything you can make it do.

Edit:

Another way to look look at it is its like having an Arduino in your pocket with a screen and a battery that can run multiple programs. The form factor and features of the device make a very versatile device for makers and hackers

That's a really interesting idea.  I presume Amiibos (and other things of that nature - Disney Infinity, Skylanders) use some kind of cryptographic challenge to ensure the legitimacy of them, but it sounds like there are some existing emulation products already.

From FAQ:

&gt;&gt;Im a noob, how can I learn to use Flipper?

We will make a wiki, the knowledge base, and how-to tutorials. This will help beginners to get familiar with Flipper features, coding, and electronics development. But it will be also very useful for experienced users and help them to dig deep inside Flippers brain  firmware architecture and electronics schematics.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-10-13
Super exited for this, I backed a few months ago, I just had a quick question. I am somewhat new to all of this and am getting this to push me to learn more and get better. Will there be a place where there will be tutorials or videos to teach from beginner to pro on how to use the device and its functions?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-29
It will look like this [https://i.imgur.com/bb3wVfO.png](https://i.imgur.com/bb3wVfO.png)

There are many use cases that impossible to run directly on Flipper Zero. Most of these cases require powerful CPU for cryptographic attacks:

* Mifare classic attacks: mfoc  
 (Nested), mfcuk  
 (Dark Side)
* Mifare Plus attack: Hard Nested

We can use Flipper Zero as a regular USB NFC adapter along with LibNFC  
 library, so all existing software will work out of the box without any modifications. This mode must be run from menu NFC -&gt; USB NFC adapter  
. In this mode all commands from PC should be forwarded directly to NFC chip ST25R3916  
 via USB serial interface.

I'm so sad I missed the campaign, I just learned about this project  would have loved to have this when me and a friend reverse engineered the IR signals to my heater a while back, trying to build a device to schedule it 
-------------------------------

flipper zero uses  MCU which does have a wifi chip inbuild, although a wifi chip can be used on it, its a hassle and you have to design a lot of your own software which is a pain while the flipper one uses RPI zero which uses Linux so it's marginally easy to develop software than writing everything from exchanging packages from scratch.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
is there a similar product that can hack barriers? i dont wanna wait so long
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
My partner has extensive knowledge with all of this so I might have to pester her for some lessons.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
No worries m8. Yeah you've got a bit of stuff to learn. I'd recommend getting a couple of Arduino or ESP8266 modules and learning how to write some basic programs for them (like flashing an LED on and off), then figuring out how to get two devices to communicate with each other (directly reading the pin states, or using the SPi or i2c bus).

I think those are both tasks an eager n00b could get on top of over a weekend or two and will certainly give you a solid base to continue learning from.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
Amazing! Thank you so much its starting to make a lot more sense now, its so hard starting out, the thought of whats possible with all this stuff makes me want to learn.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
The CPU on the Raspberry Pi would be handling the WiFi workload - the F0 would just be communicating higher-level "commands" over the GPIO pins to the RPi.

I.e., if you wanted to put the WiFi into promiscuous mode and start intercepting packets, all the F0 would be doing is telling the RPi to run the script which does that.

Does that make sense?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
Hi going to ask how it would have enough power to run through the gpio but not internally?, I'm Dad
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
Thank you for this explanation. Although I'm so new to this im going to ask how it would have enough power to run through the gpio but not internally?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-02
&gt; get a raspberry pi zero and connect it to the GPIO pins on the flipper 

This is the answer. 

u/cr44ze the onboard MCU would not be powerful enough to do anything meaningful with a WiFi chip. They would need to drastically reengineer the core of the F0 to properly integrate WiFi and make it useful. Hence why they're saving it for the F1.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-01
Underrated comment.  The gpio on this has so much potential
-------------------------------
2 : 2020-09-01
Its definitely possible, theres this thing called N2 elite that can emulate amiibo but its closed source and limited to what characters they offer in their database.

TagMo is performing an NFC write which is different than NFC emulation. I think thats also how flipper zero works in terms of scanning a card or fob and emulating it. Its definitely possible in theory but it all depends if the antenna supports emulation for the NTAG215 protocol that works with Amiibo.

I havent really looked into it yet though, Im not sure if the difference between all the NTAGS is just how the data is stored, or if its dependent on a specific antenna. It would def be a fun project tho!
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-01
[deleted]
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-01
I'm not sure that you can emulate amiibo on-the-fly. I've always seen TagMo on a phone used in writing to permanent tags. If on-the-fly was possible, couldn't the phone used just emulate without a tag?

This is just what I've seen, while looking into AC:NH amiibo emulation for a friend. I must admit, I haven't actually researched it in depth besides the above.
-------------------------------
2 : 2020-09-01
I was wondering the same thing, read them and write them to rfid tags would be cool.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-09-01
They havent even fully figured out how to do the wifi in the flipper one yet (though I believe this month they may have a candidate for a wifi chip and are beginning testing). In addition to that, you cant just simply throw a wifi chip into the configuration and expect it to work. The easiest solution if you want a wifi module for your flipper would be to get a raspberry pi zero and connect it to the GPIO pins on the flipper and write your own plugin to control its hardware with the flipper... though at that point you might as well use the pi for your wifi tasks...

Trying to get educated is never inappropriate. It can be added, it will just make the unit more bulky and need a bigger battery. They plan on adding it to the  second version of fipper. [https://flipperzero.one/one](https://flipperzero.one/one)
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-29
Interesting, but if this is possible through the pins why can't it be put inside and implemented as a part of the device?

Sorry for sounding noob but its because I am lol this is all new to me.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-29
Flipper zero has gpio pins, you can add any gpio wifi module. there are tons of modules for rasberry pi under $10
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-29
Just wait for the flipper one and get that, they are both completely different systems that will have different features, so you'll have all bases covered if you have both. And adding features to the Zero would delay it, especially ones that aren't necessary for it.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-29
Wouldn't it be possible to arrange a wifi chip to work in this configuration?

Sorry I just dont understand why it can't be done other than its not compatible, to me it seems like they need the wifi as a selling point in the flipper one unless it would interfere with the frequency of the other modules and if thats it couldn't it just work when needed only switch on when needed
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-29
Im not sure if the right NFC antenna will be in it, I still have to do some research but it would be really cool to emulate Nintendo Amiibo figures with it.

-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-28
I would say probably not within exception. Sure you may be able to use a few of the features like copying your garage door code. But most of the features of the device are intended for a specific purpose that you have to know what its for. Its like kali linux you have a lot of tools at your disposal but their all kinda useless if you dont know how to use any of them. 
But that dosent mean the device cant be used as a platform for learning.

Yes and no. 
Some of the equipment used In the trailer many people either won't have access to, or be able to use without assistance. For example, the Osciliscope (used to read and measure wavelegnths of signals) 
However, the open-spurce community, as big as it is. I am sure it will chugging out patches, custom codes, and a plethora of other useful add-ins'

Better to ask for forgiveness than permission.

They say the device won't be shipped with anything nefarious but it's up to you as to what you add to it after the fact.
-------------------------------

you can back it right now and it won't charge your card until August 29th (for me, may be a different date for you, but it doesn't charge immediately)
-------------------------------

just joined - has anyone asked the expected ship date yet?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-14
theoretically you could, but lets face it 30 or even 40 dollars is worth the hassle of part hunting, schematic drawing, assembly and firmware programming
-------------------------------

Im curious. How much do these cost to make?  Theres not much hardware there for it to cost $100usd. Cant i just make one myself for less?
-------------------------------

Technically nothing about the components is illegal. Depends rather on the software you might upgrade it with

I sent the kickstarter link to my dad and he backed one as well as i did! Hes also going to send thr link around to his office see if any one wants one too! Im super excited about it. I know its a huge risk were taking on backing this becaise he can take our money and run but it just seems to good to pass up!

Will the Flipper One be more like the Pwnagotchi in the sense of AI and Wifi Handshakes?

I was wondering, i bet you could see a nice wifi module down the road that can handle injection. connecting through the GPIO port, in a 3D printed case connecting nicely to the frame?
-------------------------------

Backed yesterday! This seem really like a great project for hackers (in the original sense of the word, i.e. people who love experimenting with tech) and can't wait! Like other posters, I am also curious about case studies/documentation/tutorials and differences with the One too.
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-05
also with the one running on ARM is there any risk for backdoor issues?
-------------------------------

So are there any other differences between the flipper zero and flipper one other than Kali Linux and the networking capability? is there anything the zero has that the one won't have like the infrared signal sender? or does the one have everything the zero will have plus the Kali stuff.
-------------------------------

This is so cool! I can't wait to play with the NFC module - I hope it's added
-------------------------------

Hey there! I dint have much experience in hacking/pentesting or coding, but after seeing an ad for this device id love to learn it. As a beginner, would it be a bad idea to purchase this?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-03
This looks like it will be a great project! Is there already a list of use-cases people have compiled?
-------------------------------
1 : 2020-08-03
